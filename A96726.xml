         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THere are a few things of which I would not have them ignorant who ſhall chance to peruſe this ſhort Hiſtory; whereof ſome concern the Lord Marqueſſe of</hi> Montroſe, <hi>whoſe Actions in his Country for two years ſpace are here publiſhed; and others have relation to the Author of this work. And firſt of all I deſire thee to take notice, that</hi> Montroſe <hi>is the Chief of that antient and famous Family of the</hi> Grahams, <hi>and is called in old Scotiſh</hi> Graham-more, <hi>the great</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. <hi>He derives his Pedegree from that famous</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>in the Hiſtories of</hi> Scotland, <hi>who was Son-in-law to</hi> Fergus <hi>the ſecond King of the</hi> Scots; <hi>and was the firſt (that with the aſſiſtance of his Father-in law) caſt down that Trench which</hi> Severus <hi>had made, and ſet out for the utmoſt limit of the Roman Empire, between the Scotiſh</hi> Frith <hi>and the River of</hi> Cluid, <hi>at ſuch a place where Great</hi> Brittain <hi>was narroweſt; and by that means cut the power of the</hi> Romans <hi>ſhorter. Whence it happens, that ſome evident remains of that Trench retain his name amongſt the Inhabitants to this day, who call it</hi> Gremeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike. <hi>The ſame</hi> Graham, <hi>from whom this noble Family took its riſe, ſurviving his Father-in-law</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
<pb facs="tcp:116038:4"/>
               <hi>and being a man as able for Civil as Military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, was made Protector unto his Nephew, and Regent of the Kingdome; and after he had fetched back the Doctors of the Chriſtian Faith, who had been baniſhed by the late Wars, and ſettled as well the Church as State with excellent Laws, freely reſigned the Government into the hands of his Nephew when he came to age. He flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the time of the Emperours</hi> Arcadius <hi>and</hi> Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>about the year of our Lord CCCC. From whom hath deſcended in a fair and ſtraight line, a long and noble row of Poſterity, who, imitating the virtue of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, have been famous in the ſucceeding generations. Amongſt whom that valiant</hi> Graham <hi>was eminent, who with the help of</hi> Dumbarre, <hi>ſo ſeaſonably reſcued his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the</hi> Danes <hi>who were then Maſters of</hi> England; <hi>and had frequently, but with little ſucceſs, invaded</hi> Scotland <hi>with mighty Armies. And in after times that noble</hi> Iohn Graham <hi>came nothing behind his Anceſtors in virtue and honour, who after the death of Alexander the Third, in that vacation of the Kingdome, while</hi> Bruce <hi>and</hi> Bailiol <hi>diſputed their Titles, was (with that renowned Vice-roy</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Walley) <hi>a ſtout maintainer of his Countries Liberty againſt the unjuſt oppreſſion and tyranny of</hi> Edward <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>and after many heroical exploits, fighting valiantly for his Nation, dyed in the bed of Honour. His Tomb is yet to be ſeen in a Chapel which hath the name of</hi> Falkirk, <hi>from the aforeſaid</hi> Gremeſdike <hi>by which it ſtands. Adjoyning unto which the Marqueſſe of</hi> Montroſe <hi>hath large and plentifull poſſeſſions, deſcended by inheritance unto him from that firſt</hi> Graham.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But leſt I ſhould ſeem to derive the Nobility of ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
<pb facs="tcp:116038:4"/>
a Worthies extraction only out of the rubbiſh of duſty and obſcure Antiquity; I muſt not omit that his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the Earl of</hi> Montroſe, <hi>was advanced unto places of the greateſt honour in that Kingdome, and diſcharged them moſt happily. For, being Lord Chancellour of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>at ſuch time as King</hi> James <hi>the Sixth of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory came to the Crown of England, he was created by him Vice-roy of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and enjoyed that higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which a Subject is capable of, with the love and good affection both of King and People to the day of his, death. And his Father was a man of ſingular endowments both of body and mind, and ſo known to be both in forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and at home: who after he had performed many moſt honourable Embaſſages for King</hi> James, <hi>was called to be Lord Preſident of the Seſſion by King</hi> Charles; <hi>and being ſnatched away from his Country and all good men by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, was extremely lamented and miſſed. And what we may think or hope of the Grand child, I leave unto thee to judge by what he hath done already, ſeeing he is yet (now a year and a half after his employment in his Country) ſcarce entred upon the 36. year of his age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One thing more I muſt add, three Periods already have been very dangerous and almoſt fatal to the Kingdome of</hi> Scotland: <hi>the firſt by the oppreſſion of the</hi> Romans, <hi>whoſe yoke our Anceſtors caſt off by the Conduct of that firſt</hi> Graham <hi>deſcended of the noble</hi> Britiſh <hi>Family of the</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentii. <hi>The ſecond by the</hi> Danes, <hi>the repulſe of whom is owing eſpecially to the proweſſe of the ſecond</hi> Graham <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And the third by the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Normans, <hi>whom the third</hi> Graham <hi>twice expelled. out of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and gave them many and great defeats. So that (as it was of old ſpoken of the</hi> Scipioes <hi>in</hi> Africk) <hi>it ſeems the name of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:116038:5"/>
Graham <hi>is ſomething fatal to their enemies, and lucky to their Country at a dead lift; and that it was not without the special provideuce of God Almighty, that in theſe worſt times One ſtood up who did his beſt endeavours to maintain the Kings juſt Rights and Authority, the Peace, Safety, and Liberty of the Subjects, and the Honour and antient ſplendor of his Houſe. And this is all I thought good at this time to premiſe concerning the Lord Marqueſs of</hi> Montroſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Author of the Book, take it briefly thus. He profeſſeth himſelf to have been but little converſant in theſe ſort of ſtudies, and expecteth neither credit or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the ſtrength of his wit (which he acknowledgeth to be little or none) nor reward or profit for his pains; which two things are the chiefeſt incentives to moſt to wet their pen; but that he undertook the buſineſſe meerly out of a deſire to propagate the truth to other Nations, and to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For he ſaw by late and lamentable experience, in ſuch a cauſe as this, that proſperous Villany can find more Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates than down-caſt Truth and Goodneſſe. For when the ſame Confederates in both Kingdomes had by their own arts (that is, by lying and ſlandering) ruined the Church, to fill their bags with its Revenews ſo ſacrilegiouſly purloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and enrich their poſterity with plentifull</hi> Anathemaes <hi>and accurſed things; there wanted no ſtore of men that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled them for it to the skies, as men deſerving highly from their Country, from the Church it ſelf, and from all mankind: and reviled with all ſort of reproaches and contumelies the moſt religious ſervants of God, holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors, for withſtanding them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might well imagine, that theſe men, who by the ſame deviſes laboured to render his Majeſty himſelf odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb facs="tcp:116038:5"/>
and ſo to deſtroy Him, to enjoy his Honours and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues ſo traiterouſly and perfidiouſly purloyned, would eaſily find men who ſhould out of the like railing humor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter as much as in them lay this moſt excellent man, and all his honourable atchievments; and (as it is ſaid of waſps) poyſon with their tongues or pens the juice of moſt ſweet and wholeſome flowers, and leave the leſſe knowing, or leſſe wary, to ſuck it up. He was therefore pleaſed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this ſhort and faithful Narrative, as a ſeaſonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt that evill, to all that loved truth and plain de aling: of which he would needs be ſo obſtinate a maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that although he ſaw well enough how much envy and hatred it would derive upon himſelf, he reſolved he would neither baſely flatter any one, nor lap up that truth which they would not like to bear in obſcure and doubtfull. Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For he profeſſes, that as he is a Free-man born and bred, ſo he will never part with his Freedome till with his life. And although he be ambitious of no other commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable quality of a good Hiſtorian, neither of wit, nor art, nor eloquence, yet he ſeems to challenge in his own right the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſincere and exact truth: for the defence and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation whereof he hath ſet at nought all that was dear in this world, having been thrice plundered of all that he had, thrice impriſoned in a naſty and filthy Fail, and now the third time lives in baniſhment for the Truths ſake. Yet he is merry and chearfull, that being conſcious to himſelf of no wrong as towards men, he is counted worthy of the Lord to ſuffer theſe things for Truths and Righteouſneſſe ſake. And thou (good Reader) make much of him at leaſt for his truths ſake; excuſe him for other things, and Farewell.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ometime <hi>James</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſided with the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and very forwardly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his unhappily happy endeavours in their behoof. They pretended to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then, leſſe than the preſervation of Religion, the Honour and Dignity of the King, the Laws of the Land, and the freedome of that antient Realm, ſo happily, ſo valiantly defended in time of yore from ſuch powerfull enemies, as the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans,</hi> by the ſweat and bloud, with the lives and eſtates of their Anceſtours. And the tales they made, they never wanted fitting inſtruments to tell and ſpread among the people. It was given out, that there was nothing more in the aim of the Court
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116038:7"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> than that that free people being reduced to a kind of Province, ſhould be eternally enflaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of their old enemies. Yet all this while they engaged themſelves by their publique atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and even a ſolemn Oath, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go to work by force and armes, nor ſollicite the King any other way than by Petition, That he would be pleaſed graciouſly to accept the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of his humbleſt Subjects, and to take order that his deareſt Country ſhould ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in matter of Religion or the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
               <p>But at laſt in the year 1639. <hi>Montroſe</hi> found out that theſe fair tales were coyn'd of purpoſe to ſteal the hearts of the ſilly and ſuperſtitious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to alienate them from the King, as an enemy to Religion and Liberty. For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters did not diſſemble to him, but ſpoke out, that <hi>Scotland</hi> had been too long governed by Kings, nor could it ever be well with them as long as one <hi>Stuart</hi> (that's the ſirname of the Kings family in <hi>Scotland)</hi> was alive: and in the extirpation of them, they were firſt to ſtrike at the head: ſo that <hi>Montroſe</hi> eaſily perceived the Kings Majeſty and Perſon was levelled at. Therefore vehemently deteſting ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a crime, he reſolved to deſert the Conſpirators ſide, to fruſtrate their counſels, to impoveriſh their ſtore, to weaken their ſtrength, and with all his might to preſerve His Majeſty and His Authority entire and inviolate. But becauſe between force and craft the Covenanters had drawn in almoſt all the Kingdom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116038:7"/>
to their ſide, he ſaw himſelf alone too weak to check their power, and therefore thought not good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen himſelf too ſuddainly or raſhly. Amongſt them he had many friends, men very conſiderable, as well in regard of their numerous retinues and clients, as of their wealth and authority: theſe he had a mind to draw off from them, and bring them with him to the King; and by this means conceived he ſhould be able to gather no ſmall power, which would conduce much both to the Kings ſafety and his own.</p>
               <p>Mean time the Covenanters raiſe a ſtrong Army againſt the King, and in a ſolemn Convention at <hi>Duns,</hi> they determine to invade <hi>England: Montroſe</hi> was abſent then. Which reſolution of theirs, the chief of the Covenanters had taken up in their cabinet counſels more than ſix weeks before; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had been buſie in divulging through all Great Britain their Apologetical Pamphlets, whereby they laboured to ſet a good gloſſe upon the reaſons of their Expedition. This reſolution of theirs, <hi>Montroſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned, ſeeing he could not binder, would not ſeem to diſapprove: <hi>Montroſe</hi> commanded in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my two thouſand foot and five hundred horſe, his friends (who were moſt obliged unto him, and had religiouſly promiſed their beſt endeavours in the Kings ſervice) had the command of five thouſand more. And truly if a great part of them had not been worſe than their words, they had either brought the whole Army along with them to the King, or at leaſt had broken the neck of the Covenanters deſigns. When the Army came to the river of <hi>Tweed</hi> (which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116038:8"/>
is the border of the two Kingdomes) dice were caſt amongſt the Noblemen and Commanders, and it was <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s chance to paſſe firſt over the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which he cheerfully performed on his feet, his own foot Souldiers following him, that he might more eaſily conceal his own reſolution, and take off all occaſion of ſuſpition. For as well his authority in the Army, as the integrity of his noble ſpirit began to be looked on with a jealous eye by the guilty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcienced Rebels, ſo that they diligently obſerved all his behaviour, words and deeds.</p>
               <p>After this, marching over the river of <hi>Tine</hi> four miles above <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> by the treachery of the Engliſh Commanders who had retreated to <hi>York</hi> with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army of the Kings, the Scots poſſeſſe themſelves of that Town: and thereupon, Commiſſioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed on either ſide to treat of a Peace, a Truce was preſently made. In the time of this Truce, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſent Letters unto the King, profeſſing his fidelity, and moſt dutifull, and ready obedience to his Majeſty; Nor did the Letters contain any thing elſe. Theſe being ſtoln away in the night, and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out by the Kings own Bed-chambermen, men moſt endeared to the King of all the world, were ſent back by them to the Covenanters at <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> and it was the faſhion with thoſe very men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto the Covenanters from day to day the Kings moſt ſecret counſels, of which they themſelves only were either authors or partakers. And ſome of the forwarder ſort of the Rebels were not aſhamed to tax <hi>Montroſe</hi> bitterly enough with thoſe Letters;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116038:8"/>
and although they durſt not make an open quarrel of it, or call him publiquely to account, becauſe he was ſo powerfull and well-beloved in the Army, yet they loaded him with backbitings and ſlanders among the people. For they had obliged unto themſelves moſt of the Preachers throughout the Kingdome, whoſe mercenary tongues they made uſe of to wind and turn the minds of the people which way they would. Nor did they promote their Rebellion more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any other way, nor do yet, than this, to have thoſe doughty Orators in their popular preachments to rail bittorly againſt the King and all his Loyal Subjects, as the <hi>enemies of Chriſt</hi> (as they love to ſpeak) being themſelves the while the very ſhame and ſcandal of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> returning into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thinking of nothing but how to preſerve his Majeſty from that ſtorm of Rebellion hanging over his head, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of this courſe. He joyns many of the prime men for Nobility and Power, in a League with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in which they vowed to defend the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and all his royal privileges, and antient and lawful Prerogatives, with the hazard of their lives and eſtates, againſt all his enemies, as well home-bred, as forein, unto the laſt breath in their bodies. And truly it came to that paſſe, that there had been an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen diviſion in the Army (which was his aim) had not ſome for fear, levity, or cowardiſe (which are bad keepers of counſel) betrayed the whole buſineſſe to the Covenanters. Hence aroſe no, ſmall ſtirs and brauls, but were pacified again in a while; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116038:9"/>
yet durſt they offer any open violence to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe.</hi> But afterward the confederates having given a new oath, made ſure the Army at their devotion; and joyning themſelves to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in a ſtrict Covenant, although they ſaw themſelves ſecure enough from the ſubtileſt deſigns of any private man, yet they ſeriouſly conſult how they ſhould take <hi>Montroſe</hi> out of the way, whoſe heroick ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixt on high and honourable (howſoever difficult) atchievements, they could not endure.</p>
               <p>To make their way therefore unto ſo villanous an act, by the aſſiſtance of ſome Courtiers whom with gifts and promiſes they had corrupted, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the King had written Letters to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> and that they were quilted in the ſaddle of the bearer, one <hi>Stuart,</hi> belonging to the Earl of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair.</hi> The bearer was ſcarce entered the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but they apprehended him, rip his ſaddle, and find the Letters. There was nothing at all written in them, which did not become the beſt of Kings to command the beſt of Subjects to obey. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoſe moſt exact crafts-maſters in the arts of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Slandering, ſent about horrible and tragical reports by their apt Miniſters, that at laſt all the Kings plots with <hi>Montroſe,</hi> for the overthrow of Religion, and the ruine of the Kingdome were found out and diſcovered. Nor yet neither durſt they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him a publique tryal, but on a ſuddain when he ſuſpected nothing, thruſt him (with <hi>Napier</hi> Lord of <hi>Marthiſtſten,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sterling Keir</hi> Knight, two both of his neer kindred and intimate familars) into the caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:116038:9"/>
At length a Pacification being made between the people of both Kingdomes, (between whom there had been no War, only they laid their heads together againſt their moſt juſt and gracious King) a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was called at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the King in perſon was preſent. <hi>Montroſe</hi> deſires moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be tryed before the King and that ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; but to no purpoſe, for the Covenanters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious enough of his innocency and their own guilt, applyed their ſpecial endeavours to detain the Gentleman in priſon unheard, untill ſuch time as the King was got out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and they had conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all things with the King in Parliament according to their hearts deſire. And certainly they were much afraid, leſt by his wiſdome, and courage, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem he was in, as well with his Peers of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as with the people, he ſhould have fetch'd off the greateſt number of either ſort to his own reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for the preſervation of his Majeſties Power and Authority. At laſt the King returning into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Montroſe</hi> and his friends are ſet at liberty: and becauſe it was ordered in Parliament that he ſhould not come into conference with the King, he ſat ſtill a while at his own houſe. This was towards the end of the year 1641.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1642. the Covenanters of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes began to unmask themſelves, and let us ſee more plainly what they meant to do. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116038:10"/>
in <hi>England</hi> began to vex the King with unjuſt, unreaſonable, unſeaſonable Petitions and Complaints, beſpatter him with malicious ſlanders, prophane his ſacred Name in ſcurrilous Songs and Ballads, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him in infamous Libels, Paſquils, or Pamphlets, raiſe Tumults, arm great numbers of the ſcum and raſcally ſort of the people, and engage them upon the Kings palace; in a word, threaten all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to him and his: whom although he might have juſtly puniſhed himſelf, yet he choſe rather to refer them to the Parliament, that he might the more oblige it unto himſelf. But it was to no end for ſo gracious a King to gratifie that and many things more, to ſo ungracious, ſo ingrateful men, who were the very Authors and Abettors of theſe villanies. For he had already granted more and greater Graces to his Subjects, for the caſe of their grievances (which they pretended) and the ſecurity of their perſons and eſtates, than all his Anceſtors the Kings of <hi>England</hi> together, from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror downward. Therefore at laſt, that he might withdraw himſelf and his family from preſent danger, he is forced ſore againſt his mind to depart <hi>London:</hi> He ſends the Queen out of the way into <hi>Holland</hi> for the ſafety of her life, and betakes himſelf to <hi>York.</hi> The States of Parliament (as they call themſelves) forthwith, and before the King, take up arms, and divert thoſe very Forces which the King had appointed for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which were then in a readineſſe, and whoſe Officers had been of the Parliaments chuſing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by them to overthrow the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:116038:10"/>
The Rebels in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who knew well enough the King would have ſtrength ſufficient to deal with the Engliſh Rebels, reſolved upon no terms to be wanting to their confederates in ſo apparent danger as they were. And although our moſt gracious King had given them ſatisfaction (as much as ever they could deſire) in that Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which alſo they have recorded among their publique Acts, nevertheleſſe they provide themſelves for a march into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that they might the better ſecure their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home, they labour tooth and nail to draw <hi>Montroſe</hi> (of whom almoſt only they were afraid) again to their ſide. They offer him of their own accord the office of Lieutenant General in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and what ever elſe he could deſire, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. He ſeeing a mighty ſtorm hovering over the Kings head, that he might give him an account of it, whereby it might be timely prevented, undertakes a journey into <hi>England,</hi> taking the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> into his counſel and company.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> he receives news that the Queen being newly returned out of <hi>Holland</hi> was landed at <hi>Birdlington</hi> in <hi>Yorkeſhire:</hi> thither he makes haſte, and relates unto the Queen all things in order. She, having had a rough paſſage, and being not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the diſtempers at Sea, told him ſhee would adviſe further with him about that buſineſſe after they came to <hi>York.</hi> Thither being come, the Queen of her own accord calls for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the whole ſtory over again, and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116038:11"/>
that there was no leſſe danger from the Scotch than from the Engliſh Covenanters, if they were not timely ſuppreſſed. And being asked his opinion what was beſt to be done, anſwered, <hi>To reſiſt force with force;</hi> told her, <hi>the King wanted not Subjects in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>faithful men, and ſtout; nor did they want hearts, or wealth, or power to oppoſe againſt the Covenanters if they durſt enterpriſe any thing againſt the King: all that they wanted was the Kings Commiſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they durſt doe nothing, with which any thing; and all the danger that was, was in delay: That the Covenanters, when they had once got their Army on foot would be able to grind any one to pieces that ſhould offer to ſtir; therefore the beginnings of ſo great an evill were to be withſtood, and the cockatrice bruiſed in the egg; that Phyſick being too late that comes when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath over-ran the whole body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wholeſome counſel it was, and ſeaſonable, which doubtleſſe the moſt prudent Queen had approved of. But while things were going on in ſo good a poſture, all things were quaſh'd by the comming of the Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon pretence of kiſſing the Queens hand, and gratulating her happy return, but in very deed that he might overthrow <hi>Montroſe</hi> his counſels; for he had poſted thither with the knowledge and conſent of the Covenanters. Nor did he himſelf diſſemble that there was ſome danger from the Scotiſh Covenanters, but he laboured to extenuate it; and condemned the Counſell of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> as raſh, unadviſed, and unſeaſonable. <hi>That ſtout and Warlike Nation was not to be reduced with force and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116038:11"/>
arms, but with gentleneſſe and courteſies: Warr, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Civil Warr, ſhould be the laſt remedy, and uſed many times to be repented of even by the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. The fortune of Warr was uncertain; if the King ſhould get the beſt, it would be but a ſorry tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph he could enjoy over his own Subjects; but if he had the worſt on't, he muſt expect what his ſoul</hi> (good man) <hi>abhorred to ſpeak. All means were to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve peace with that Nation, nor were things yet come to that paſſe, that the King ſhould deſpair of amity and reconciliation with them: He would be ready to take the whole buſineſſe upon himſelf, if the King pleaſed to commit it to his pains and truſt, and to authoriſe him ſuſſiciently thereunto.</hi> Montroſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Nothing would come of that but the delay of time, untill the Traitors having raiſed an Army ſhould prevent the King of any means to deliver himſelf and his party from their tyranny.</hi> The ſad event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all this to be too true; but in this debate <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> was fain to ſuffer himſelf to be overborn, being not ſo great a Courtier as the other; nor were thoſe vertues which the world now admires, diſcovered then unto the Queen. <hi>Hamilton</hi> returning into <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeemed to be as Active for the King as was poſſible.</p>
               <p>The Covenanters mean while by their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (contrary to the known Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) ſummon a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> which all underſtanding men that wiſhed well unto the King foreſaw would be of very dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his affairs, and therefore abhorred it ſo much, that they intended not to honour it with their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116038:12"/>
preſence. But <hi>Hamilton</hi> interpoſing the name and authority of the King, invited them by his Letters that they would not fail to be all there; and that they ſhould not doubt but they would be able to out-vote the Covenanters, if at this time they were not wanting to the Kings cauſe. And if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwiſe, he would be ready with his friends, to proteſt againſt the Covenanters, and immediately to leave them. Abundance of the Nobility incited by the name of the King, and thoſe hopes, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that Parliament, only <hi>Montroſe</hi> and a few of his adherents ſtaid away. And with <hi>Montroſe</hi> too the Duke had dealt by his friends, that as he loved and honoured the King he would joyn himſelf unto them. But he (who had reaſon to ſuſpect all motions that came that way) anſwered, That he was ready to grapple with any difficulty, eſpecially under his command who had ſo great an honour as to be the Kings ſupreme Commiſſioner; only on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Duke ſhould engage his honour, that if they could not bring up that Parliament to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous things, he would endeavour to inforce them by the dint of the ſword. He anſwered, He would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, he would not fight. Which paſſage conſidered, <hi>Montroſe</hi> to preſerve his integrity, expecting the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, betook himſelf to his own home.</p>
               <p>In that Parliament, the Covenanters out-voted the Loyal party by ſeventy voices or thereabouts, trampled upon the Royal authority, arrogated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves the power of calling of Parliaments, preſſing Souldiers, ſending Embaſſadours, and other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116038:12"/>
things hitherto unattempted, without the Kings knowledge or conſent. And to make up the meaſure of their preſumption and treaſon, ordain that a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Army ſhall be raiſed againſt the King, and in the aid of their confederates of <hi>England.</hi> To which purpoſe they tax the people with new Subſidies and Levies, much heavier, than if all the Impoſitions which upon never ſo much neceſſity for two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſpace by one hundred and nine Kings have been charged upon them, were put together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore, who ſaw the King was like to be ruined by his own authority, and ſaw too that he was too weak to oppoſe himſelf both againſt the ſtrength of the Covenanters and the Kings abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Commiſſion, in a melancholy mood made as if he took no notice of any thing. And the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuppoſing he had received ſome diſtaſte from the King, by reaſon of the affront he received at <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Hamiltons</hi> over-powring him, they ſet upon him yet again, privately and by friends, to ſee if by intreaty or intereſt they could draw him to their ſide; offering him Authority and wealth, even the greateſt honour Civil and Military. Which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers he did not ſeem much to ſlight, that by that means he might have an eaſier way to dive into their counſels. The Covenanters, that this growing friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might be the better cemented and ſanctified (God bleſſe us) ſend unto him that great Apoſtle of their Covenant, <hi>Alexander Henderſon,</hi> who ſhould give him full ſatisfaction in all his ſcruples. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> heartily deſired to ſpeak with that fellow, out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116038:13"/>
of whom he doubted not to pump all the ſecrets of the Covenanters: and leſt a private meeting with ſuch a man ſhould give a ſcandal to the Kings friends, he took the Lords <hi>Napier</hi> and <hi>Ogilby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Keer</hi> to be witneſſes of the diſcourſe, and on the bank of the river <hi>Forth,</hi> not far from <hi>Sterling,</hi> they met.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> made as though he accounted himſelf very happy, and much honoured in the viſit of ſo worthy a man, upon whoſe faith, honeſty, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſo much relyed. Told him, <hi>That to give the ill opinion of his Enemies leave to breath it ſelf after ſome late miſtakes, he was content to ſtay at home; that he knew nothing of what was done in Parliament; that he was almoſt at a loſſe how to behave himſelf in that tickliſh condition the Commonwealth ſtood; and therefore beſeeched him for old acquaintance ſake to let him freely knew what they intended. Henderſon</hi> taking it for granted by theſe expreſſions, that he was wheeling about towards the Covenanters, that he might the more oblige the Marqueſſe unto him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him flatly and without more adoe, <hi>That it was reſolved to ſend as ſtrong an Army as they could raiſe, in aid of their brethren of</hi> England <hi>againſt the Kings forces; that the Covenanters of both Kingdomes had unanimouſly agreed upon this, either to dye or bring the King to their lure; that nothing could fall out more happily, than that he ſhould renew his friendſhip with his Peers of the Nobility, and the reſt of the Kingdome; that ſo doing he would give great content to all men, beſides the honour and profit that would redound to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116038:13"/>
himſelf; that by his example others (if others there were that idolized the empty ſhadow of the Kings name) would joyn themſelves unto the Covenanters; and for his own part he would give moſt hearty thanks unto his Lord God, that he had vouchſafed to make uſe of him as the Miniſter and ever Mediatour of ſo great a work;</hi> and at laſt entreated him <hi>to ſpeak out his mind, and commit all ſuch things to his care and induſtry as he ſhould deſire from the Parliament, either in relation to his honour or profit; aſſuring him he ſhould be ſatisfied to his hearts deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> having gotten out the knowledge of thoſe things which he eagerly ſought for, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf how he ſhould keep <hi>Henderſon</hi> and his party in ſuſpence a while, that they ſhould not get within him. For what anſwer could he give them? If he ſhould profeſſe himſelf to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their courſes, that would doe the King no good, and might bring a great deal of danger upon himſelf: and on the other ſide, to put them in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes of him, by promiſing thoſe things he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to perform, he ſcorned, as being a ſtain unto his honour. Therefore he takes this courſe; there was preſent at that conference with <hi>Henderſon</hi> one Sir <hi>Iames Rollock,</hi> Chief of a very antient and flouriſhing family: his former wife had been <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> his Siſter, after whoſe death he married the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the ring-leader of the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland:</hi> thus being allied unto them both, he ſeemed to be a very fit mediator of friendſhip between them. <hi>Montroſe</hi> askes him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116038:14"/>
thoſe things which had paſſed between them proceeded from the direction of the Parliament, or out of their own good wills? He anſwered, He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Maſter <hi>Henderſon</hi> had received Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Parliament to that purpoſe; But <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> ſaid no; but he made no queſtion but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would make good any thing that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Montroſe</hi> told them, he could reſolve upon nothing except he had the Publique faith to build upon, eſpecially the meſſengers diſagreeing between themſelves. Whereupon (as the faſhion is on ſuch occaſions) one of them layes the blame upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when both of them ought rather to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their own careleſneſſe and negligence. The conference being thus ended, <hi>Montroſe</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his ends, and they being no wiſer than they came thither, every own went his own way.</p>

                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> being returned from this Conference, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all things as they had paſſed unto ſome ſelect friends whom he could ſafely truſt; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all entreated them, that (for the greater confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the buſineſſe) they would all go along with him to the King; that his Majeſty receiving a full account of all things, might lend his ear to ſound counſell, and (yet if it was poſſible) provide a remedy againſt ſo threatning evills.

Montroſe</hi> who could by no means be removed from ſo honeſt a reſolution, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his counſell to the Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> (whom of all men he eſpecially loved) goes ſtraight to <hi>Oxford.</hi> The King was abſent thence, being gone to the ſiege of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> he imparts unto the Queen what deſigns the Scotiſh Covenanters had againſt his Majeſty; but he had as good have ſaid nothing, for ſhe had determined not to believe a word, by reaſon of the far greater confidence ſhe repoſed in <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſeeing no good was to be done with the Queen, goes to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and declares all things to the King himſelf: How <hi>there was a powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to be raiſed in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and a day appointed on which it ſhould be brought into</hi> England; <hi>how their counſels were manifeſtly known unto him, and how to fetch him over to their ſide, they had offered him very honourable commands in the Army; but that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deteſting ſo horrid an employment had ſled to his Majeſty; that he having notice thereof, if he were not able to provide ſo timely and powerful a remedy as could be wiſhed, at leaſt might caſt ſome blocks and rubs in their way, untill ſuch time as he had ſetled his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116038:15"/>
affairs in</hi> England; <hi>that the Traitours of either King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might be eaſily dealt withall by themſelves, but if they came once to joyn their forces, they would be hardly ſuppreſt; that there were very many in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>who would ſacrifice themſelves and all that they had for their deareſt King, whoſe good will would be of no uſe unto his Majeſty after the Covenanters had raiſed their Army, but deſtructive unto themſelves; that the haughty ſpirits of the Traitors were to be ſneap't in time, and their ſtrength broken before it grew too big, leſt the beginnings being neglected, repentance ſhould prove the only oppoſition that could be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</hi> Theſe things, and to this effect, did <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> continually preſſe unto the King, but in vain, for he had not only the ſtrong and deeply-rooted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence his Majeſty had of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> to ſtruggle with, but the devices of a ſet of deſperate Courtiers beſide, who daily buzzed in the Kings eares <hi>Montro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe's</hi> youth, his raſhneſſe, his ambition, the envy and hatred he bare unto the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and what not; and on the other ſide, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> fidelity, their honeſty, their diſcretion, their power. Thus <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe</hi> nothing prevails, and the King returns to his winter-quarters at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And although his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſaw very well (reports comming thick and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of the Scotiſh Army) that all was true that <hi>Montroſe</hi> had told him, yet the moſt religious King determined upon no terms to give any occaſion of quarrell to the Scots till firſt they entered <hi>England;</hi> reſolving, that he for his part would perfectly obſerve the articles of Pacification he had made with them,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116038:15"/>
which if they ſhould violate, he doubted not but they ſhould highly anſwer it both to God and him. While theſe things were diſcuſſed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Scotland</hi> bring their buſineſſe about according to their deſires, no one oppoſing them. They raiſe as big an Army as they can, which conſiſted of eighteen thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe; and at laſt when they had marched unto the very borders, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were not aſhamed to give the King no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by Letters of the approach of that formidable Army; making this their excuſe, that according to their engagement, they had prevented an invaſion the ſummer before, but now that winter was come on, they were able to keep them out no longer, but they would come in immediately with a powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The King, when he ſaw himſelf thus groſly abuſed, ſends for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſhews him the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and at laſt (when it was even too late) askes his advice what was beſt to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> tells him, that his Majeſtry might now ſee, that what he had before given him notice of, had neither proceeded from ambition, nor malice, nor any ſelf-ends, but from his bounden duty and allegiance; that for above a twelve-month he had been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſſing both their Majeſties to prevent this; that he accounted himſelf very unhappy, that all that while ſo faithfull a ſervant could not be credited by ſo good a Maſter; that the caſe ſeemed now deſperate, but if the King had a mind he might truſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain who by pretence of his authority had bound ſome of his friends hands that they could not aſſiſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116038:16"/>
him, and drawn in others, who intended nothing leſſe, under colour of Loyalty to fight againſt him, and given up unto the Rebells, now that they had got an Army, all that they had, without ſtriking a ſtroke. The King complaining that he was moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly betrayed by them with whom he had entruſted his Crown, his Honour, his Secrets, his Life, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly demanded his advice. He repeating again the lamentableneſſe of the condition in which things now ſtood, nevertheleſſe offered, that if his Majeſty ſo thought good, he would either loſe his life, which if he did, he would be ſure it ſhould ſeem rather ſold then loſt, or elſe (which he did only not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair) he would reduce his Country-men, and bring the Rebels there into ſubjection. The King being no little pleaſed with the confidence, undauntedneſſe, and gallantry of the man, that he might more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly contrive his deſign, deſired him to take two or three dayes to conſider of it, and ſo diſmiſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> returning at the time appointed, ſhews his Majeſty how deſperate an adventure he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; that all <hi>Scotland</hi> was under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters command, that they had Garriſoned all places of ſtrength, that they were plentifully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both of men, and mony, and armes, and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and victuall, and all things neceſſary for a Warr; that the Engliſh Rebells were joyned with them in a moſt ſtrict Covenant to defend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt all the world. But for his own part he had nothing to ſet up with, neither men nor arms, or pay; yet he would not diſtruſt Gods Aſſiſtance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116038:16"/>
in a righteous cauſe, and if the King would lay his Commands upon him, he would undertake to do his beſt. The King ſhould be in no worſe caſe than he was, He himſelf would take what malice, envy, or danger ſhould fail, upon himſelf, ſo that his Majeſty were graciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend to a few rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable requeſts. And firſt, that the buſineſs might go on more ſucceſſively, it ſeemed to him very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the King ſhould ſend ſome Souldiers out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into the Weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Next, that he ſhould give order to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (who was the General of the Kings forces towards <hi>Scotland)</hi> that he ſhould aſſiſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of horſe to enter the South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which means he might convey himſelf into the heart of the Kingdome. Then, that he ſhould deal with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for ſome troops of <hi>German</hi> horſe. And laſtly, that his Majeſty ſhould take ſome courſe to procure and tranſport ſome arms out of ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein country into <hi>Scotland:</hi> nothing needed more but humane induſtry, the ſucceſs was Gods part, and to be referred to his providence. The King commending his counſel, and giving him thanks that he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſome life in the buſineſs, encourageth him to fit himſelf cheerfully for ſo great a work, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him to leave the care of thoſe things he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, unto him.</p>
               <p>And truly, for the matter of aid out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King ſends for the Earl of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and acquaints him with <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s deſign. This <hi>Antrim</hi> is of Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh extraction, deſcended of the noble and antient

And as for forein aids and arms, the King ſent Sir <hi>Iohn Cockeram</hi> his Embaſſadour about it with his Commiſſion and Inſtructions. And directions unto the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> were carried by ſome of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s own company. Who receiving the Kings Letters and Commiſſion to be Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and General of the Army there, made himſelf ready for his journey. In the interim news came on a ſuddain that Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with his brother the Earl of <hi>Lannerick</hi> were poſting up to <hi>Oxford.</hi> They, that they might make their acceſs eaſier to the King, who had hitherto given ear unto their counſels, and to continue or recover the good opinion the King had of them, gave out all the way as they came, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto Governours of Shires and Towns, and Commanders of the Army, that they were baniſhed their Country, that they had been plundered of their eſtates by the Covenanters for their loyalty to the King, and that for ſafety of their lives, with which they had hardly eſcaped, they fled to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But <hi>Montroſe</hi> and thoſe of his mind ſaw plainly that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116038:17"/>
theſe were but tales of their own making, of purpoſe to wipe off the ſuſpition of this new guilt; and that by this means, they in confidence of that eſteem they had lately with the King, and of a ſtrong faction they drove at Court, doubted not but they ſhould ſtand as fair in his opinion as ever, if they were but once admitted into the Kings preſence; and that the only buſineſs they had thither, was by defeating <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> again, clearly to extinguiſh that little ſpark of Loyalty that was not yet quite out in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And <hi>Montroſe</hi> delivered himſelf freely, that for his part he would never ſtand by to be witneſs of ſo great an overſight: and therefore humbly beſought the King, that he would give him leave to ſeek his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in ſome forein Country, if theſe men that had deceived him ſo oft ſhould be received again into favour, not that he deſired any ſeverity ſhould be uſed againſt them, only he wiſhed the King might have a care that they ſhould do him no more harm. The King was drawn with much adoe that they ſhould be forbidden the Court, yet for all that he ſuffered the Earl of <hi>Lannerick</hi> to live in the City. But he (by whoſe inſtigations I cannot tell) betakes himſelf from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>London</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and not long after to the Scotch Army, which had now entered <hi>England,</hi> and never ſince hath failed to do them the beſt ſervice he could. The eſcape of his brother ſo much moved the King, that he ſaw it high time to ſecure the Duke himſelf.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral Scots in the Kings Court and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116038:18"/>
Army who were ſuſpected (and perhaps not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon) to favour the Covenanters too much, and to give intelligence unto them of the Kings Counſels. <hi>Montroſe,</hi> that he might put theſe to the touch, took this courſe; He got a proteſtation to be drawn up by the Kings authority, unto which all Scots who would have the reputation of honeſt men were to ſet their hands: Wherein <hi>they profeſſed themſelves heartily to deteſt the courſes of the Covenanters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned eſpecially the bringing in of an Army into</hi> England <hi>againſt the King and the Laws of the Land as an Act of high treaſon, promiſed and vowed to acquit themſelves of that ſcandal, and to the utmoſt of their power, with the hazard of their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to oppoſe thoſe that were guilty of that crime.</hi> This Proteſtation all men of honour and honeſty readily took; but there were two, in whom the King truſted moſt of all Scotch-men next to the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> to wit, the Earl of <hi>Trequaire,</hi> and Maſter <hi>William Murray</hi> of the Bed-chamber, who were difficulty brought unto it at laſt, with much reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and fear of being diſcovered traitours: yet even they engaged themſelves by a ſolemn Oath at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day to be aiding and aſſiſting unto <hi>Montroſe</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Oath of theirs afterward they moſt unworthily violated.</p>
               <p>This being done; and <hi>Montroſe</hi> on his journey from <hi>Oxford</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe that were the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> creatures; and other falſe-hearted Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers began to blaſt the Honour of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> to call him a vain and ambitious man, who had attempted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116038:18"/>
an impoſſible thing: to extol above meaſure the power of the Covenanters, and that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr every one from engaging himſelf in ſo noble an exploit, gave out every where moſt maliciouſly, that no good was ever to be expected from <hi>Montroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being little troubled with the calumnies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men, came forward to <hi>York,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> where he ſees that the Kings Inſtructions be ſent to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the next day they met and conferred. <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> diſcours'd of nothing but the diſtreſſes and neceſſities of his Army; how the Rebel Scots breaking in in the midſt of winter, had ſpoyled his Recruits, and that now in farr grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter numbers than he, they quartered within five miles of him; that he could not poſſibly ſpare any Horſe without a manifeſt hazard to the whole Atmy. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> urged on the other ſide, that nothing could doe <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> more ſervice than to let him have a party of Horſe (in which he was very ſtrong) with him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that ſo he might either divert, or at leaſt divide the enemy, and by kindling a fire in their own houſes, fetch them home again to defend themſelves. <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> courteouſly replyed, that aſſoon as he had wound himſelf out of that preſent danger, he would not be wanting in any ſervice to <hi>Montroſe:</hi> which promiſe, there is no doubt but a perſon of ſo much Honour and Loyaltie would moſt ſurely have performed, had he continued any while in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thoſe parts. In the mean time, all that he could do for the preſent was; to afford him about one hundred Horſe, but lean ones, and ill accourred,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116038:19"/>
(which was not the Generals fault, but ſome mens private ſpleen) with two braſſe Field-pieces.</p>
               <p>Moreover he ſent his Orders unto the Kings Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Commanders in <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they ſhould give <hi>Montroſe</hi> all the ſuccour and aſſiſtance they could make for his journey into <hi>Scotland. Montroſe</hi> going towards <hi>Carliſle</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly met by the <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> men, conſiſting of eight hundred Foot, and three troops of Horſe; who according to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Command, were to wait upon him into <hi>Scotland. Montroſe</hi> himſelf brought with him two hundred Horſe, moſt of them Noblemen and Gentlemen, and ſuch as had been Captains either in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> With which ſmall forces (not over-truſty neither) he entered <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 13 of <hi>April;</hi> for he made the more haſte, leſt he ſhould have been abſent at the time appointed by the Earl of <hi>Antrim.</hi>

already paſs'd, there came not ſo much as a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from them, nor the leaſt report of them into <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the Covenanters gathering themſelves together on every ſide, there was no ſtaying there any longer for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> without being ſupriſed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returns ſafe to <hi>Carliſle</hi> with his men.

               <p>For having ferreted a Garriſon of the Covnanters out of the town of <hi>Morpet,</hi> he took in the Caſtle, permitted all the pillage unto the Engliſh, and taking an Oath of them that had held it, that they ſhould never more fight againſt the King, he ſent them away without any greater puniſhment.

               <p>All things thus failing <hi>Montroſe,</hi> from which he expected any aſſiſtance, yet his ſpirit never ſailed him: therefore returning to <hi>Carliſle</hi> with thoſe few but faithfull and gallant men that ſtuck cloſe to him, he ſends away the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> into the heart of <hi>Scotland</hi> in mean diſguiſe, leſt they ſhould be diſcovered by the enemy. Within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they returned, and brought word that all things in <hi>Scotland</hi> were deſperate; all Paſſes, Caſtles, Towns, poſſeſſed with Garriſons of the Covenanters, nor could they find any one ſo hardy as to dare to ſpeak reverently or affectionately of the King. Moſt of thoſe who had adhered to <hi>Montroſe</hi> all this while, being caſt down with this ſad news, bethought themſelves of bending their courſes ſome other way, eſpecially when they were tampered with by that honeſt man the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> to deſert the ſervice: who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all his vowes and imprecations he had made before the King, undertook in the name of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, not only for Indemnity to all that ſhould fall off unto them, but rewardes and preferments too; as if he had been all this while an Agent for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116038:20"/>
and not for the King, as he pretended. And yet this man was greater in the Kings favour, and more confided in, than any one except the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> calling his friends to counſell, deſires them to deliver their opinions what they conceived was fitteſt to be done in this ſad face of things. Some adviſe him to repair to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and certifie him that his Scotch Affairs were paſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; that <hi>Antrim</hi> came not with his Iriſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor was there any appearance of them; that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no aſſiſtance had been obtained from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; and as for Armes or aid from Forein parts, he had not ſo much as heard a word of them; ſo that it was none of his fault that his ſervice had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe. Others were of opinion, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to excuſe himſelf by Letters unto the King, and to ſend up his Commiſſion along with them, and that he himſelf ſhould ſtep a while aſide into ſome other Countrey, till ſuch time as it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend better opportunities. But all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this, that nothing more was to be attempted or thought of in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But he himſelf only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained farr other thoughts in his high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted ſpirit: He conceived himſelf bound never to forſake his deareſt Lord the King though in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt hazards, and that it was an unworthineſſe to deſpair of ſo good a cauſe; and if he ſhould attempt ſome greater matter than came within the reach or apprehenſion of common men, he conjectured it might prove much to his own Honour, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perhaps to the Kings good too. For as it was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116038:21"/>
dubious whether it might pleaſe God in his mercy to look upon the King with a more favourable eye, and to turn his adverſity into proſperity; ſo it was moſt certain, that if he ſhould not be able to goe thorough with it, but periſh in the enterpriſe, he ſhould die with Honour, and his fall ſhould be much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. So reſolved, and commending himſelf and his ſucceſſe to the diſpoſal and protection of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, he performed ſuch Adventures without men, without money, without arms, as were not only to the aſtoniſhment of us that were preſent, and were eye and ear witneſſes of them, but alſo the example and envy both of all great Commanders hereafter. What thoſe were we ſhall declare by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> delivers thoſe few Gentlemen that had been conſtant unto him to the Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> to be conducted unto the King, (for as he had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated all his former deſigns unto him, ſo he did this alſo) and conjureth him withall to deal earneſtly with his Majeſty for haſtening of ſome aid, if not of Men yet of Arms at leaſt, from beyond Seas; So he accompanying them two dayes on their journey, and leaving with them his Horſes, his Servants, and his Carriages, conveyed himſelf privily away from them, and with what ſpeed he could, came back to <hi>Carliſle.</hi> The company ſuſpecting nothing of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, becauſe <hi>Ogilby</hi> and other his deareſt friends were ſtill with them, marched on ſtraight towards <hi>Oxford;</hi> but thither they never reached, for moſt of them (of whom were the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> himſelf, Sir <hi>Iohn Innes,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Henry Graham</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116038:21"/>
a moſt hopefull young Gentleman, <hi>Iames, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Ogilbyes, Patrick Melvin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gallant men, and highly eſteemed by <hi>Montroſe)</hi> fell into the enemies hands, and endured a long and naſty impriſonment, untill they were ſet at liberty by <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf the next year, after which they did him moſt faithful ſervice. He returning to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle</hi> imparts his deſign to the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> leſt he ſhould have any occaſion to cavil afterwards, that a matter of that conſequence was done without his knowledge or advice, who might have proved able to give a great ſtroke to the advancing of it. But when he found ſomething too much ſickleneſſe in that young man, he was not over earneſt to engage him to adventure with him in ſo perillous a journey; and therefore eaſily perſwaded him to reſide at <hi>Carliſle</hi> till he heard further news out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which time it might be more ſeaſonable for him to return into his Country.</p>
               <p>And now being prepared for his journey, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected only two men for his companions and guides; one was Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> a Gentleman of moſt known honeſty, and an able man both of his head and hands. The other was one <hi>Sibbald,</hi> whom for the report of his valour and gallantry, <hi>Montroſe</hi> did equally love and honour: but the latter afterwards deſerted him in his greateſt need. <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing as <hi>Sibbalds</hi> man, and being diſguis'd in the habit of a Groom, rode along upon a lean jade, and led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother horſe in his hand. And ſo he came to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where he found all ordinary and ſafe paſſes guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116038:22"/>
by the enemy. There was a chance happened which put them in a greater fright than all that, and it was this; not farr from the borders they hit by chance upon a ſervant of Sir <hi>Richard Grahams,</hi> who taking them for Covenanters, and to be of <hi>Leſley</hi>'s Army who uſed to range about thoſe parts, told them freely and confidently that his Maſter had made his peace with the Covenanters, and had undertaken (as if he were their Centinel) to diſcover unto them all ſuch as came that way whom he ſuſpected to favour the King. An unworthy act it was of a ſhameleſſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, of whom not only <hi>Montroſe</hi> had a very high eſteem, but his Majeſty alſo, whoſe miſtaken boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had raiſed him out of the dunghill (to ſay no worſe) unto the honour of Knighthood, and an eſtate even to the envy of his neighbours.</p>
               <p>Having not paſſed much further, they met a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a Scotchman but one that had ſerved under the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who taking no notice of the other two Gentlemen, came to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> and ſaluted him by his name: <hi>Montroſe</hi> giving no heed unto him, as if he were no ſuch man, the too officious ſouldier would not be ſo put off, but with a voyce and countenance full of humility and duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out, <hi>What? Doe not I know my Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of</hi> Montroſe <hi>well enough? Goe your way, and God be with you whitherſoever you goe.</hi> When he ſaw it was in vain to conceal himſelf from the man, he gave him a few crowns, and ſent him away, nor did he diſcover him afterwards. But <hi>Montroſe</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf much concerned in theſe ſpeeches,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116038:22"/>
thought it the beſt courſe to make all the haſte he could, and to run faſter than the news of him could flie: nor did he ſpare any horſe-fleſh, or ſcarce draw a bridle till after four dayes travell he came to the houſe of his coſen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> of <hi>Innisbrake,</hi> not far from the river of <hi>Tay,</hi> on that ſide of the Sherif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Perth</hi> which is next the Mountains. This <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> being deſcended of the Noble family of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> and not unworthy of ſo noble parentage, was deſervedly in very great eſteem with the Marqueſſe; who ſojourned beſides him for a little while in the day time in a mean cottage, and paſſed the nights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the neighbouring mountains. For hee had ſent away his companions unto his friends, that they might inform themſelves exactly of the whole ſtate of the Kingdome, and bring him word in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they found it.</p>
               <p>After a few dayes, having examined the matter with all the induſtry they could uſe, they return with nothing but ſad and tragical news: <hi>That all the Subjects that were honeſt and loyal, lay under the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Rebells; and of ſuch as had been ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to endeavour to recover their freedome with their ſwords, ſome were put to death, others fined, others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet in priſon, dayly expected the worſt their enemies could doe: That the Marqueſſe of</hi> Huntley <hi>had laid down the arms which too unadviſedly he had taken up, at the firſt ſummons of the enemy; that indeed he had had no contemptible number of men, but the men wanted a good Commander; that his friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents were expoſed to the implacable malice and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116038:23"/>
revenge of their enemies, and that he himſelf had fled to the utmoſt corner of the Iland, and ſculked upon another mans land. Montroſe</hi> was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled (as he had reaſon) at this news, eſpecially at <hi>Huntley</hi>'s errour, and the ruine of the <hi>Gordons,</hi> who were men of ſingular loyalty and valour, and expert ſouldiers, therefore much lamented by him, that for no fault of theirs, they ſhould come to ſo great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. And now he began to caſt about how hee might draw them to himſelf, that they might try a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the fortune of War under another General in the behalf of his moſt excellent Majeſty.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time there were ſome uncertain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſpread abroad among the Shepheards who kept their flocks in the Mountains, of certain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh who were landed in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and canged about the Mountains. <hi>Montroſe</hi> conceived it not unlikely that theſe might be part of thoſe Auxiliaries which the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhould have been there four months before: but he had no certainty what they were, till at laſt ſome Letters came from ſome intimate friends of his, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, and from <hi>Alexander Mac-donald,</hi> a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo, to whom <hi>Antrim</hi> had given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief of thoſe few Iriſh, directed to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe.</hi> Theſe they had taken care to ſend to a certain friend of his, a ſure man, that he might convey them if it were poſſible to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> where <hi>Montroſe</hi> was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116038:23"/>
believed ſtill to remain. He, who never dreamed of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s return into <hi>Scotland,</hi> though he ſojourned by him, by chance acquainted Maſter <hi>Patrick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with the buſineſſe, he promiſeth to take charge of them, and undertaketh to ſee them ſafely dilive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> though be made a journey as far as <hi>Carliſle</hi> a purpoſe; and ſo by the good providence of God they came into his hands much ſooner than could be expected. And he writes back, as from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> that they ſhould be of good comfort, for they ſhould not ſtay long either for ſufficient aſſiſtance to joyn with them, or a General to command them; and withall requires them forthwith to come down into <hi>Athole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Athole</hi> were engaged unto <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> by many obligations, men whom he valued moſt of all the Highlanders, both for their Loyalty, Piety, Conſtancy, and ſingular Valour; and truly they made good his opinion of them to the very end of the War. The Iriſh, with a very few Highlanders who were almoſt all of <hi>Badenoth,</hi> receiving <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s commands, marched ſtraight into <hi>Athole.</hi> He, who was not above twenty miles from them, comes to them immediately, and ere ever they looked for him, on foot, in the habit of a Mountainer, without any man along with him ſave the aboveſaid <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> his guide and companion. And indeed the Iriſh would hardly be perſwaded that that was <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe;</hi> but when they ſaw him ſo ſalured, and only not adored like ſome great Deity, by the men of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole</hi> and others that knew him well, they were over
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116038:24"/>
ver joyed: for his comming to them was in exceeding good time, they being then in extream danger to be cut off. For <hi>Argyle</hi> was in their rear with a ſtrong and well ordered Army, the champain Country were ready in Arms before them, expecting if they ſhould make down into the Plain, to trample them to dirt with their horſes hoofs; the veſſels that brought them over were burnt by <hi>Argyle,</hi> that they might have no way to retreat; nor would the <hi>Arthole</hi> men or any other that favoured the King venture any hazard with them, becauſe they were ſtrangers, and came not by the Kings open and known Authority; nor had they any Commander of ancient Nobility, a thing by the Highlanders much ſet by, who would not fight under the command of <hi>Alexander Mac-donald,</hi> a man of no account with them; laſtly their number was inconſiderable, being not above a eleven hundred, though ten thouſand had been promiſed.</p>
               <p>The next day, the <hi>Arthole</hi> men to the number of eight hundred put themſelves in arms, and offered their ſervice moſt cheerfully to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who having got this handfull of men, and earneſtly commending his moſt righteous Cauſe to the protection of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, now deſired nothing more than to be among the thickeſt of the enemy. Impatient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of further delay, that very day he marches through the Plains of <hi>Athole</hi> towards <hi>Ern;</hi> as well to make way for his friends and aſſiſtants eaſier acceſſe unto him (if any ſhould riſe upon the news) as that he might fall upon and amaze the Rebels, unlook'd for, before they ſhould be able to joyn together who lay
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116038:24"/>
at diſtance. Therefore paſſing by <hi>Weem,</hi> a caſtle of the <hi>Menizies,</hi> ſeeing they handled a Trumpetter whom he ſent friendly unto them unworthily, and fell hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the rear of his Army, he waſtes their fields, and cauſes all their houſes and corn to be fired; this was at the very firſt onſet of the War, to ſtrike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into the enemy. The ſame night he paſſed over <hi>Tay,</hi> the greateſt river in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with part of his Forces; the reſt follow him very early the next day. When they were ready to march on, he gave <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> (of whom I ſhall have often to ſpeak, and never without honour) at their earneſt requeſt the Command of the <hi>Athole</hi> men, and ſent him with the nimbleſt of them he could pick out amongſt them to ſcout before. He brings word he ſaw ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers drawn up on the top of an hill at <hi>Buckinch:</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them <hi>Montroſe</hi> makes ſtraight. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be commanded by the Lord <hi>Kilpont</hi> ſon to the Earl of <hi>Taith,</hi> a man of antient Nobility, and deſcended of the <hi>Grahams;</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> a kinſman alſo of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe;</hi> who were both of them ſummoned by the Covenanters to joyn againſt the Iriſh as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and had with them five hundred Foot and no more; nor had they heard any certainty at all of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s being in thoſe parts. He reſolveth with all ſpeed to ſurpriſe them, and either to win them to his ſide, or to cruſh them to pieces. But they as ſoon as they heard that <hi>Montroſe</hi> was General of thoſe Forces, ſend unto him ſome of their chiefeſt friends to underſtand from him what he intended to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116038:25"/>
doe. He tells them he had the Kings Authority for what he did, and was reſolved to aſſert that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the utmoſt of his power, againſt a moſt horrid Rebellion, conjuring them by all the obligations that were between them, that they would not think much to doe their beſt endeavours for the beſt of Kings. VVhich as it was much becomming their high birth, and would be very acceptable ſervice to the King, ſo it would be beneficial unto them for the preſent, and much to their honour with poſterity and ſtranger, if they of all others ſhould be the firſt that put to their helping hands to hold up a tottering Crown. They moſt readily without any delay came in unto him, for both of them, though underhand, favoured the King exceedingly.</p>
               <p>From them <hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters were thick in arms at a Rendevouz at <hi>Perth</hi> (the ſecond City to <hi>Edinburgh)</hi> and there wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their enemies falling down from <hi>Athole.</hi> He knowing alſo that <hi>Argyle</hi> with his Army was upon his back, leſt he ſhould be hemm'd in on both ſides, determins to goe forward to <hi>Perth,</hi> that there he might either force the enemy to fight, or reduce the Town to the Kings obedience. Marching therefore three miles from <hi>Buckinch,</hi> and allowing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers but a ſhort time of refreſhment, at the break of day he draws out his men. Nor was he above three miles more from the City, when the enemy was in view in a large and open Plain (called <hi>Tipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more)</hi> providing to fight. They were commanded by the Lord <hi>Elchoe,</hi> one that was taken for no great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116038:25"/>
ſouldier: there were with him the Earl of <hi>Tullibar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi> but this latter (as was conceived) againſt his will, for he and his fathers whole family favoured the King in their hearts: Knights he had with him good ſtore, among whom Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> (who heretofore had done good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice under the State of <hi>Venice)</hi> was the moſt noted ſouldier. They had ſix thouſand Foot and ſeven hundred Horſe, and in confidence of their numbers, they had even devoured their enemies before they ſaw them. It was on Sunday the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> and it was given in charge to their Miniſters, that in ſet ſpeeches they ſhould encourage the people to fight, not forgetting to mind them of their moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant forſooth. And to give them their due, they plyed their lungs ſtoutly in the performance of that work; they moſt freely promiſed them in the name of Almighty God an eaſie and unbloudy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; my, there was one <hi>Frederick Carmichael,</hi> one very much cryed up for learning and holineſſe by the ſilly people, who was not afraid to deliver this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in his Sermon, <hi>If ever God ſpake word of truth out of my mouth, I promiſe you in his name aſſured victory this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods ſervice being thus finely performed as they thought, they put their men in <hi>Battalia. Elchoe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf commanded the right flank, Sir <hi>James Scot</hi> the left, and the Earl of <hi>Tullibardin</hi> the battel. To the right and left flanks were added wings of horſe, with which they made no doubt on ſo fair a Plain to hem in the enemy. <hi>Montroſe</hi> perceiving the great
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116038:26"/>
body of the enemy, and eſpecially their ſtrength in Horſe, (for he had not ſo much as one Horſe-man, nor more than three lean horſes) and being carefull (as it concerned him) leſt being incompaſſed with ſo great a number, they ſhould fall upon him in the Front, Rear, and Flank, he cauſed his Army to be drawn out to as open order as could be poſſible, and makes his files only three deep. He commands the Ranks all to diſcharge at once, thoſe in the firſt Rank kneeling, in the ſecond ſtooping, and in the hindmoſt, where he placed the talleſt men, upright: he chargeth them alſo to have a care of miſ-pending their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of which they had ſo ſmall ſtore, and that they ſhould not ſo much as make a ſhot till they came to the very teeth of their enemies; and aſſoon as they had diſcharged their muskets once a piece, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to break in upon the enemy with their ſwords and musket ends; which if they did, he was very confident the enemy would never endure the charge. <hi>Montroſe</hi> undertakes the Command of the right Flank over againſt Sir <hi>James Scot,</hi> appoints the left to the Lord <hi>Kilpont,</hi> and the main Battel to <hi>Mac-Donald</hi> with his Iriſh: which was very providently ordered, leſt the Iriſh who were neither uſed to fight with long Pikes, nor were furniſhed with ſwords, if they had been placed on either flank, ſhould have been expoſed to the fury of the Scotch-Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſent unto the Commanders of the enemy, <hi>Drummond</hi> Son and Heir to the Lord <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derty,</hi> a noble Gentleman, and accompliſhed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 line">

Montroſe, <hi>as well as the Kings Majeſty from whom he had received his Commiſſion, was moſt lender of ſhedding his Countreys blood, and had nothing more in his devotions, than that his victories might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without a red Letter. And ſuch a victory they might obtain as well as he, if they ſhould pleaſe but to have the honour to conquer themſelves, and before a ſtroke were ſtruck to return unto their Allegiance. That for his part he was covetous of no mans wealth, ambitious of no mans honour, envious of no mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, thirſty, after no mans blood; all that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red was, that in the name of God they would at length give ear to ſound counſell, and ſubmit themſelves and what belonged unto them unto the grace and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo good a King: who as he had hitherto conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended unto all things (either for matter of Religion or any thing elſe) which they thought good to ask, though to the exceeding great prejudice of his Prerogatives; ſo ſtill they might find him like an indulgent Father ready to embrace his penitent children in his arms, although he had been provoked with unspeakable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. But if they ſhould continue ſtill obſtinate in their Rebellion, he called God to witneſſe, that it was their own stubborneſſe that forced him to the preſent encounter.</hi> The Commanders of the enemies anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing at all to all this, but againſt the Law of Nations ſent the Meſſenger (who out of meer love to his Countrey had undertaken the employment) priſoner with a company of rude Souldiers unto <hi>Perth,</hi> vowing aſſoon as they had got the victory, to cut off his head. But God was more mercifull to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116038:27"/>
him, and provided otherwiſe than they intended, for the ſafety of that gallant man.</p>
               <p>They were come within musket ſhot, when the enemies under the Command of the Lord <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> ſent out a forlorne hope to provoke <hi>Montroſe</hi> to a light skirmiſh: he ſends a few to meet them, who at firſt onſet diſorder and rout them, ſending them back to their main body in no ſmall fright. <hi>Montroſe</hi> thought now was his opportunity, and that nothing could conduce more either to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of his own ſouldiers, or the terrour of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, than immediatly to fall upon them as they were diſordred and aſtoniſhed with that freſh blow, nor would he give them time to rally or recover courage: therefore ſetting up a great ſhout he lets looſe his whole Army upon them. The enemy firſt at diſtance diſcharge their Ordnance, which made more noiſe than they did harm, afterwards marching forward, their Horſe labour to break in upon <hi>Montroſes</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; thoſe, when their powder was ſpent, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had neither Pikes nor ſcarce Swords, they ſtoutly entertain with ſuch weapons as the place would afford, good ſtones; of which they poured in ſuch numbers amongſt them, with ſo greatſtrength and courage, that they forced them to retreat, and to trouble them no more. For the Iriſh and Highlanders ſtriving bravely whether ſhould outvie the other in valour, bore up ſo eagerly when they gave ground, that at laſt they betook themſelves to the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Horſes heels. There was ſomething more to do a little while longer in the right Flank.

Sir <hi>Iames Scot</hi> diſputed ſome time for the higher ground, but <hi>Montroſes</hi> men being ſtronger bodied, and eſpecially ſwifter footmen, obtained the Hill; from thence the <hi>Athole</hi> men ruſhed down with their drawn ſwords upon the enemy, and making little account of the muſquetiers, who ſent their bullets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as thick as hail, cloſing with them (as they lik'd beſt to fight) they ſlaſh'd and beat them down. At laſt the enemy not able to abide their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fairly ran away. Moſt of the Horſe made ſo good ſpeed as to ſave themſelves; but there was a great ſlaughter of the Foot, whom they purſued for ſix or ſeaven miles. There were conceived to be two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the Covenanters ſlain, and more were taken priſoners: of whom ſome taking a Military Oath, took up arms again with the Conquerour; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly, for almoſt all forſook him afterwards. The reſt taking a Solemn Proteſtation that they would never after bear arms againſt the King, he ſet at liberty. He took in <hi>Perth</hi> the ſame day, without doing the leaſt harm unto the City, although moſt of the Citizens had fought againſt him in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; thinking by ſo great clemency to turn the hearts of the people towards their King, which was the only end to which he directed all his defigns.</p>

               <p>HE ſtaid three dayes at <hi>Perth,</hi> for there he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ected many in thoſe parts to come in with their friends and clients armed, who upon the noiſe of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116038:28"/>
late victory profeſſed themſelves moſt faithfull to the King; but none came but the Earl of <hi>Kinowl</hi> with a few gentlemen of <hi>Gowry,</hi> nor did they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue very conſtant unto him neither. And by this time <hi>Argyle</hi> was at haud with a great Army of Foot of his own, and ſupplies of Horſe were joyned with him out of the South parts; therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing over the <hi>Tay</hi> took up his Quarters in the field (for other quarters he ſeldome had) near <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> a little village in <hi>Angus,</hi> where a famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery once ſtood, but now lies on the ground. Here a brave young gentleman Sir <hi>Thomas Ogilby</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> with others of the Gentry of <hi>Angus,</hi> met him, and readily offered him their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; whom he curteouſly entertained, and ſent them a way with thanks, they pretending they only went to fit themſelves for a march, nevertheleſſe few of them returned beſides the <hi>Ogilbies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next morning by break of-day before the <hi>Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> was beat, there was a great tumult in the Camp, the Souldiers ran to their armes, and ſell to be wild and raging; <hi>Montroſe</hi> gueſſing that it was ſome falling out between the Highlanders and the Iriſh, thruſt himſelf amongſt the thickeſt of them: there he finds a horrible murther newly committed, for the noble Lord <hi>Kilpont</hi> lay there baſely ſlain. The murtherer was a retainer of his own, one <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> whom he had treated with much friendſhip and familiarity, in ſomuch that that ſame night they lay both in a bed. It is reported that the baſe ſlave bad a plot to diſpatch <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and in regard of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116038:28"/>
great power he had with <hi>Kilpontin,</hi> he conceived he might draw him in to be acceſſary to the villany, therefore taking him aſide into a private place, he had diſcovered unto him his intentions; which the Nobleman highly deteſted, as was meet; whereupon the murtherer fearing he would diſcover him, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him unawares, and ſtabbed him with many wounds, who little ſuſpected any harm from his friend and creature. The treacherous aſſaſſine by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Centinel eſcaped, none being able to purſue him, it being ſo dark that they could ſcarce ſee the ends of their Pikes. Some ſay the traitor was hired by the Covenanters to do this, others only that he was promiſed a reward if he did it. Howſoever it was, this is moſt certain, that he is very high in their favour unto this very day, and that <hi>Argyle</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately advanced him (though he was no ſouldier) to great commands in his Army. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was very much troubled with the loſſe of this Nobleman, his dear friend, and one that had deſerved very well both from the King and himſelf, a man famous for Arts and arms, and honeſty; being a good Philoſopher, a good Divine, a good Lawyer, a good Souldier, a good Subject, and a good man: And embracing the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe body again and again with ſighes and teares, he delivers it to his ſorrowfull friends and ſervants to be carried to his parents to receive its funeral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies as became the ſplendor of that honourable Family.</p>
               <p>With the reſt of his Forces <hi>Montroſe</hi> marcheth to <hi>Dundee:</hi> the Town being proud of the number of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116038:29"/>
its inhabitants, and having a Garriſon out of <hi>Eife</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, refuſed to ſubmit. And he, thinking it no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to hazard the honour he had gotten by his late victory upon the doubtful ſucceſſe of a ſiege, turns away toward <hi>Esk;</hi> for he hoped that many of his friends and kindred, being men of greateſt note in thoſe parts, and who uſed to talk as highly what they would do for the King as any others, would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to joyn with him. But they having news of his approach withdrew themſelves: only the Lord <hi>Ogil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> a man of threeſcore years old, (with his two Sons, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Sir <hi>David,</hi> and ſome of his friends and clients, men of experienced reſolutions) joyned himſelf unto him: and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable conſtancy he went along with him through all fortunes unto the very end of the War; being in that almoſt univerſal defection, the other honour and ornament of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> beſides <hi>Montroſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Montroſe</hi> was hereabouts, he receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that ſome Commiſſioners from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters (of whom the Lord <hi>Burghly</hi> was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal) lay at <hi>Aberdene</hi> with an Army, and laboured to aſſure unto themſelves the Northern parts, upon which <hi>Montroſe</hi> eſpecially relyed, either by fair means or foul. He determines to fight theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before <hi>Argyle</hi> could come up to them, therefore with long marches he hies thither: and poſſeſſing himſelf of the bridge upon the river of <hi>Dee,</hi> and drawing near the City, he found the enemy drawn up cloſe beſide it. <hi>Burghley</hi> commanded two
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:116038:29"/>
thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, whom he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in wings; and having choſen his ground, and planted his great Guns before his men, he expected battel. <hi>Montroſe</hi> had fifteen hundred Foot (for the Lord <hi>Kilponts</hi> ſouldiers were gone to convey their Lords dead body to his parents, and moſt of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men after the victory of <hi>Perth</hi> were gone home, from whence they were not farr, laden with ſpoil) and juſt four and forty Horſe, of whom he made two diviſions, and mixing amongſt them the beſt fire-men and Archers that he had (who in nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſwiftneſſe of body were almoſt as good as Horſemen) placed them on either wing, to prevent the falling of the enimies horſe upon his rear; which they performed moſt gallantly beyond the opinion or perhaps the belief of many. He gave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the right flank to <hi>James Hay</hi> and <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Gordon,</hi> and of the left to Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> all valiant men. The left wing of the enemy was commanded by <hi>Lewis Gordon,</hi> Son to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley,</hi> a bold young man and hot ſpirited, but hair brain'd, and one that had forced out his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers friends and clients to fight with <hi>Montroſe</hi> againſt their wills. He having gotten the plain and moſt commodious ground for fighting on horſe-back, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s right flank: which when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he commanded <hi>Rollock</hi> with his twenty Horſe to their aid; and they, being backed with the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of their Commanders, and the activity and ſtoutneſſe of the Foot amongſt them, received the charge with ſo much hardineſſe, that they four and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116038:30"/>
forty, beat back full three hundred of the enemy, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all and killing very many. But becauſe they were ſo few they durſt not follow the chaſe which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the great prudence of the Commanders, and proved to be of great conſequence towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the victory: for the enemy charged <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s left Flank (which had no Horſe) with their right Wing of Horſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore in a trice (now that <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men were fled) conveighs the ſame Horſe to the left Flank; who ſeeing they were not able to draw themſelves into a Body like the enemies, fetch'd a compaſſe about, and ſo eſcaped their firſt charge; then neatly wheeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout they fell upon the Flank of the enemy, and with their naked ſwords, beat, and cut, and vanquiſht, and put them to flight. They took priſoners one <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Kragevar</hi> a Knight of great eſteem with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and another <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Boindle.</hi> Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated got ſafe away, becauſe that ſo few could not ſafely purſue them. They that commanded the enemies Horſe were not ſo much frighted with their loſſe, as vexed with the diſgrace of a double repulſe, therfore imputing their defeat to thoſe light fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks that were mixed with <hi>Montroſes</hi> Horſe, they themſelves call for Foot-men out of their main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, intending to return with greater courage. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſuſpected that, and was loath to engage thoſe few gallant men again, (whoſe Horſes were ſpent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in two ſharp ſervices,) with the enemy who was reinforced with freſh Foot. Therefore obſerving the enemies Horſe not yet rallied ſince their new rout,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116038:30"/>
and ſtanding at a ſufficient diſtance from their Foot; he rode about among his own Foot, (who had been ſore galled already with the enemies Ordnance) and beſpeaks them to this effect: <hi>We do no good my (fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſouldiers) while we diſpute the matter at thus much diſtance, except we cloze up with them how ſhall we know an able man from a weak, a valiant man from a coward? If ye would aſſail theſe timorous and brawneleſſe ſhrimps with handy-blows, they will never be able to ſtand you. Goe to therefore, fall about them with your ſwords and but-ends of your muskets, beat them down, drive them back, and make them pay what is juſtly due for their treaſon and rebellion.</hi> It was no ſooner ſaid, than they fall to work, break in upon the enemy, defeat them, rout them. Their Horſe who expected Foot to come and line them, ſeeing them all run away, ran faſter than they: whom the Conquerours were not able to follow, much leſſe to overtake, ſo they ſcap'd ſcot-free; but the Foot paid for all, few of which eſcaped the Victors hands. For having no other place to fly unto but into the City, <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men came in thronging amongſt them through the gates and poſterns, and laid them on heaps all over the ſtreets. They fought four hours upon ſuch equal terms, that it was an even lay whether had the odds. At this Battell <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſome great Guns, but they were unſerviceable, becauſe all advantages of ground were poſſeſſed by the enemy; but, the enemies Guns made no ſmall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of his men. Among others, there was an Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had his legg ſhot off with a Cannon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116038:31"/>
only it hung by a little skin; he ſeeing his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſouldiers ſomething ſad at his miſchance, with a loud and cheerfull voyce cryes out, <hi>Come on, my Comrades, this is but the fortune of Warr, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor I have reaſon to be ſorry for it. Do you ſtand to it as becomes you, and as for me, I am ſure my Lord Marqueſſe, ſeeing I can no longer ſerve on foot, will mount me on horſe-back:</hi> So drawing out his knife, being nothing altered nor troubled, he cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder the skin with his own hand, and gave his legg to one of his fellow ſouldiers to bury. And truly, when he was well again, and made a Trooper, he often did very faithfull and gallant ſervice. This bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell was fought at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> on the twelfth day of <hi>September,</hi> 1644. Then <hi>Montroſe</hi> calling his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers back to their Colours entred the City, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them two dayes reſt.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time news was brought that <hi>Argyle</hi> was hard by with much greater forces than thoſe they dealt with laſt, the Earle of <hi>Lothian</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him with fifteen hundred Horſe. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> removes from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to <hi>Kintor</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage ten miles off, that he might make an eaſier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto him for the <hi>Gordons</hi> (the friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley)</hi> and others that were ſuppoſed much to favour the Kings cauſe. From thence he ſends Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to acquaint his Majeſty with the good ſucceſſe he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:116038:31"/>
had hitherto obtained, and to deſire ſupplies out of <hi>England,</hi> or ſome place elſe. <hi>That he had fought twice indeed very proſperouſly, but it could not be expected, that ſeeing he was ſo beſet on all ſides, with great and numerous Armies, he ſhould be able to hold out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes without timely relief.</hi> Still nothing troubled <hi>Montroſe</hi> more, than that none of the <hi>Gordons,</hi> of whom he conceived great hopes, came in unto him. And there wanted not ſome of them, who teſtified their great affection to the ſervice, but that <hi>Huntley</hi> the chief of the Family, being a back-friend to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> had with-held them all, either by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or private directions; and that himſelf being forced ro ſculk in the utmoſt border of the Kingdome, envied that honour to another of which he had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf, and had forbidden, even with threats, all thoſe with whom he had any power, to have any thing to do with <hi>Montroſe,</hi> or to aſſiſt him either with their power or counſell. Which when he underſtood, he reſolved to withdraw his Forces into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Faſtneſſes, where he knew the enemies horſe (wherein their great ſtrength conſiſted) could do them little ſervice; and of their Foot (if they were never ſo many) relying upon the juſtice of his cauſe, and the valour of his ſouldiers, he made but little reckoning. Therefore he hid his Ordnance in a bogg, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his troubleſome and heavy carriages; And comming to the ſide of the river <hi>Spey,</hi> not farr from an old caſtle called <hi>Rothmurk,</hi> he incamped there: with an Army, if one reſpect the number, but very ſmall, but it was an expert and cheerfull one, and now
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116038:32"/>
alſo ſomething accquainted with victory.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the <hi>Spey,</hi> he finds the men of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> and <hi>Suderland,</hi> and <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> and others to the number of five thouſand up in arms to hinder his paſſage over the ſwifteſt River in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> till ſuch time as <hi>Argyle</hi> who marched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him was upon his back. Being oppreſſed, and as it were beſieged with ſo many enemies on every ſide, that at leaſt he might ſave himſelf from their Horſe, the turned into <hi>Badenoth,</hi> a rocky and mountainous Countrey, and ſcarce paſſable for Horſe. There, for certain dayes he was very ſick, which occaſioned ſo immoderate joy to the Covenanters, that they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to give out he was quite dead, and to ordain a day of publique Thankeſgiving to Almighty God for that great deliverance. Nor were their Levites you may be ſure backward in that employment in their Pulpits; for as if they had been of counſell at the Decree, and ſtood by at the execution, they aſſured the people, that it was as true as Goſpel, that the Lord of Hoſtes had ſlain <hi>Montroſe</hi> with his own hands. But this joy did not laſt them long, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in a ſhort ſpace; and as if he had been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, he frighted his enemies much more than he had done before. For aſſoon as his diſeaſe would give him leave, he returned into <hi>Athole,</hi> and ſent away <hi>Mac-donald</hi> with a party unto the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, to invite them to take up arms with him; and if they would not be invited, to force them. He himſelf goes into <hi>Angus,</hi> hoping it might happen that he ſhould either force <hi>Argyle</hi> with his tyred
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116038:32"/>
Horſe unto his Winter quarters, or at leaſt leave him far enough behind him. For <hi>Argyle</hi> had purſued him ſlowly, and at ſuch diſtance, that it was apparent he thought of nothing leſſe than of giving him battail. Therefore going through <hi>Angus,</hi> and getting over the <hi>Grainsbain</hi> (which going along with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ridge from Eaſt to Weſt, divideth <hi>Scotland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two equal parts) he returned into the North of the Kingdome. And now that he had left <hi>Argyle</hi> ſo far behind him, that he might ſafely take ſome time to recruit, he went to <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> that he might meet with the <hi>Gordons,</hi> and perſwade them to engage with him. But he loſt his labour, for they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled by <hi>Huntley,</hi> and after his example plaid leaſt in ſight. For ſuch as were generous and daring ſpirits, though they were loath to provoke the indignation of their Chief, yet they could not but be aſhamed, that at a time when there might be ſo much uſe of them, they did nothing. Beſides, the Lord <hi>Gordon, Huntley</hi>'s eldeſt Son (a man of ſingular worth and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was detained by <hi>Argyle</hi> his Uncle by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide: the Earl of <hi>Alboin</hi> the ſecond Son was incloſed within the ſiege of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Son was of the enemies ſide; ſo that there was no one of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s family under whoſe authority they ſhould take up Armes.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Montroſe</hi> quartered there a great while; in which time almoſt every other night marching, ſeven, or eight, or ten miles with a party of light Foot (for Horſe he had few or none) he uſed to give alarms to the enemy, beat up their quarters
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116038:33"/>
put them to flight, and frequently to bring home horſe and men priſoners. And becauſe he alwayes brought his men ſafe off, it was ſtrange to ſee how cheerfull and daring his ſouldiers were; ſo that though their number was not great, there was nothing that he would lead them on unto, that ſeemed great to them. At laſt when he deſpaired of any good to be done with the <hi>Gordons,</hi> at the end of <hi>October</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> and came to <hi>Faivy</hi> Caſtle and poſſeſt it. There he was like to have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undone by the bad and falſe intelligence his Scouts, in whom he put great confidence, brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him concerning the enemy: for thoſe whom they perſwaded him were ſcarce got over <hi>Grainsbain,</hi> were on a ſudden encamped within two miles of him. <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Lothian</hi> had there two thouſand five hundred Foot, and twelve hundred Horſe: <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> now when <hi>Mac-donald</hi> was abſent with a party, had fifteen hundred Foot and about fifty Horſe. If he ſhould have deſcended into the Plain with ſo ſmall ſtrength, it had been madneſſe; and to keep a Caſtle (and no ſtrong one neither) he thought diſhonourable and derogatory to the credit of his late victories. Therefore he bethought himſelf of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, he drawes his men up unto a higher hill which over-look'd the Caſtle. The ſoil of the hill was rough, and there were hedges alſo and ditches caſt up there by the Husbandmen for the fences of their fields, which were almoſt as uſefull as Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. But before he had appointed every one his ground to draw up in, thoſe few of <hi>Huntley</hi>'s depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116038:33"/>
which accompanied <hi>Montroſe</hi> from <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogy,</hi> in the ſight of all people fairly betook them to their heels. And on the other ſide, the enemy driving fiercely up the hill, made themſelves maſters of no ſmall part of it; which if they had been able to maintain with the ſame vigour that they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had been a loſt man: whoſe Souldiers, diſcouraged both by the timorous flight of ſome of their own, and the multitude of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies forces, were well near ready to turn their backs; them <hi>Montroſe</hi> preſently put life and courage into by his own example and preſence, by putting them in mind of their former atchievements, and their own ſenſe of their wonted proweſſe. Moreover, he thus beſpake a young Iriſh Gentleman, one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>O Kyan, Go thy way, O Kyan, with ſuch men as thou haſt at hand, and drive me thoſe fellows out of yonder ditches, that we may no more be troubled with them.</hi> The gallantry of <hi>O Kyan Montroſe</hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen and commended, nor did that truly valiant man deceive the Generals opinion of him, for he quickly firretted the enemy out of the ditches, though they much out-numbred his men, and were ſeconded with a party of Horſe. And not only ſo, but gained ſome baggs of powder which the enemy had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them for haſte, a very ſeaſonable prey, of which they had great need. Nor doth a notable example of the forwardneſſe of the Souldiers ſeem to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in this place to be remembred; for one of them looking upon the baggs of powder, <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have they given us no bullets? Marry but wee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116038:34"/>
muſt fetch bullets too from thoſe ſparing distributors of Ammunition.</hi> As if it had been altogether the enemies duty to provide them neceſſaries for the Warr.</p>
               <p>In the mean time his Horſe (which were but fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) being diſpoſed in a place of danger, he timely ſecured them by lining them with musketiers. For <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> charged them with five whole troops, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had croſſed over half a field that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, being ſcared with our ſhot, wheel'd about, and returned to the place from whence they came. <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men being encouraged with theſe two ſucceſſes, could hardly be kept off from falling on with a ſhout upon the whole body of the enemy: whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> refrains rather with a kind of commendation of them (as was meet) than reproof, only bids every one know his own duty, and wait his commands. Towards night, <hi>Argyle</hi> having done nothing to any purpoſe, retreats two miles off, and ſlept not that night. But the next day, when he was told that <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers had great ſcarcity of powder and bullet, drawing his men into the ſame ground again, he made as though he would have charged up the Hill, and beaten <hi>Montroſe</hi> out of his hold. But when his heart failed him in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, beſides ſome skirmiſhes between ſmall parties while the main bodies kept their ground, there was nothing done that day neither. All this while <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſends for all diſhes, and flaggons, and chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, and what other pewter veſſels could be had, and cauſed them to be melted into bullet; yet when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116038:34"/>
that was done the ſouldiers had not enough. With which great inconvenience the ſouldiers were ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled, that one as often as he made a ſhot (which he preſumed never miſſed) he would ſay mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to his Comerades, <hi>As ſure as can be I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one Traytors face with a chamber-pot.</hi> Nor wil any one wonder if <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men were oft in want of powder and other neceſſaries for War, when he conſiders they had no other way to ſupply themſelves with them, but out of their enemies ſtock. And now the ſecond day being almoſt ſpent, <hi>Argyle</hi> withdraws his men over the river, the way that they came, three Scotch miles (which make one Dutch mile) off. The time was thus ſpent at <hi>Faivy</hi> for ſeveral dayes, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> carrying nothing away with that great Army, but diſgrace among his friends, and contempt among his enemies; for it was wholly imputed to his cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe that there he had not made an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> (leſt by marching away in the day time he might have ſome of his Rear cut off by the enemies Horſe) takes the advantage of the night to return to <hi>Strathbogy:</hi> where he intended to make ſome ſtay, both becauſe the craggineſſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was a good ſecurity to his Souldiers againſt the incurſions of the enemies Horſe; and becauſe it was near thoſe places from whence he dayly expected <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> with what Highlanders he could raiſe. The next day the enemy purſues him with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to force him to fight with them in the open field: and truly aſſoon as they came in ſight of them, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116038:35"/>
up their men they made ready to battel, as if they would have fallen on with all their power. But a forlorn hope of Highlanders was ſent before by <hi>Argyle</hi> to engage <hi>Montroſe</hi> in a light skirmiſh, who were manfully entertained and repulſed. Then <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> having poſſeſſed himſelf of the higheſt ground, <hi>Argyle</hi> alters his reſolution, and thinks upon that which was more ſafe and leſſe honourable. He deſires a Ceſſation, propoſes that engagements may be given on both ſides for a Conference and Treaty; yet at the ſame time, he did not only tempt the Souldiers to forſake <hi>Montroſe,</hi> by promiſing them indempnity and rewards to boot; but (which is a ſhame to ſay even of an enemy) ſet a great price upon <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s head, to be paid unto any aſſaſſine or murtherer that ſhould bring it in. Of which, when <hi>Montroſe</hi> was well aſſured, (who well knew the diſpoſition of the man to be more bent to over-reach and betray, than to fight with his enemy) he thought nothing concerned him more, than with all ſpeed to bring off thoſe ſmall Forces he had, as far as he could, both from <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Horſe and knavery.</p>
               <p>Therefore calling a councill of War, he declares his opinion; they all approve his wiſdome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to continue their fidelity and their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſerve him. Therefore he reſolveth upon a long march the next night, as far as <hi>Badenoth;</hi> and that the Souldiers might be lighter for ſo great a journey, he ſent the Carriages before with a guard, and bid the Souldiers make themſelves ready againſt the next day, as if they were to fight. And now the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116038:35"/>
Carriages were on the way, when on a ſuddain news came that <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Craigevar,</hi> a priſoner, (to whom upon the engagement of his Honour for his true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment <hi>Montroſe</hi> had given the liberty of the Camp) and that <hi>Sibbalds,</hi> who beſides <hi>Rollock</hi> was only of his counſell and company when he came out of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome others, had made an eſcape and run away to the enemy. He was troubled at the perfidiouſneſſe of the men, and juſtly ſuſpected that they, to ingratiate themſelves with the enemy, would betray his counſels. Therefore he ſtraight called back the Convoy with the Carriages, and ſeemed as if he had wholly altered his reſolutions. But indeed he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them not, but thought it fit to delay them for a time, that the intelligence which the enemy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his fugitives might appear unto them idle and uncertain. But after four dayes he ſent the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages away again before him, and making fires through all the Camp, he placed all the Horſe he had within view of the enemy, as if they kept their guard there, till ſuch time as the Foot were marched far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from danger, and then brought the Horſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſafe off, and all by break of day came to <hi>Balve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> And now being ſafe from having their quarters beaten up by the enemies Horſe, and they no further purſuing, it being alſo the very deep of winter, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a few dayes unto the refreſhment of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. And at this time eſpecially <hi>Argyle</hi> began to appear in his own colours, and his ſubtilties were manifeſted. For moſt of the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and prime Souldiers that were with <hi>Montroſe</hi> (who
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116038:36"/>
ſetting aſide Iriſh men and Highlanders, had more Commanders than private Souldiers in his army) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him, and fell off to <hi>Argyle.</hi> Some of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſickneſſe, others diſability to make ſuch long marches in winter time over mountains uninhabited; unpaſſable, full of nothing but ſtones and bryars, for the moſt part deep in ſnow, and never travelled over by any man alive. And therefore ſore againſt their wills, as they ſaid, and being compelled to depart by an extream neceſſity, they deſired his Paſſe: which he denyed to none that ask'd; but yet look'd upon them rather with a kind of indignation and ſcorn, than approbation or compaſſion. Nor can one eaſily ſay how much the example of ſuch men weakened his Forces, and how much it diſheartened many that intended to have liſted themſelves under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But the old Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> a man of threeſcore years old, and not very healthy neither, together with two of his Sons moſt worthy of ſuch a Father, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and Sir <hi>David,</hi> could never be perſwaded, even in the extremeſt hazard of their lives, to depart from him.</p>

                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> returning from <hi>Balveny</hi> to <hi>Badenoth</hi> net a very faithful intelligencer, who gave him notice that <hi>Argyle</hi> with his Foot (for his Horſe were gone to their winter-quarters) lay at <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> and that from thence he uſed all his induſtry to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Athole</hi> men to revolt. He, although he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116038:36"/>
was aſſured of their loyalty, nevertheleſſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible haſte goes down into <hi>Athole.</hi> For in one night he marched with his Forces four and twenty miles, through wayes untrodden, untilled, full of ſnow, waſte, and never inhabited by mortal man, to the intent he might fall upon <hi>Argyle,</hi> whiles he had not his Horſe about him. But he being frighted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his coming, when <hi>Montroſe</hi> was yet ſixteen miles off, bid his men ſhift for themſelves, and he himſelf fled as faſt as he could into <hi>Perth,</hi> wherein the Covenanters had a ſtrong garriſon. <hi>Mac-donald</hi> was by this time returned, and brought along with him the Chief of the <hi>Mac-renalds</hi> with his men to the number of five hundred: and <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that number <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> with ſome choice men of <hi>Athole.</hi> Being recruited with theſe, he marcheth to the lake out of which the river of <hi>Tay</hi> breaks forth, to paſſe from thence through <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalbin</hi> into the Country of <hi>Argyle;</hi> for he thought an enemy could never be ſo happily overthrown as in his own Countrey. And truly he had many ſtrong reaſons for that reſolution. <hi>In the firſt place</hi> Argyle'<hi>s power and authority amongſt the Highlanders rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him formidable to his Peers and Neighbours, and ſo conduced much both to raiſe and foment the whole Rebellion; For aſſoon as any one adventured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Covenanters, or diſpute their Command, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently</hi> Argyle <hi>gathering a tumultuous army of five or ſix thouſand Highlanders (who for all that ſerved him againſt their wills) cruſh'd him in pieces; and therefore he had all the reaſon in the world to bring
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116038:37"/>
down the power of ſo ſeditious, and covetous, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell a man. Moreover, thoſe Highlanders who did not only favour the Kings cauſe, but hated</hi> Argyle <hi>heartily, as having had a ſufficient experience of his Tyranny, durſt not appear as they would, till he was firſt ſubdued. And laſtly the Low-lands of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were maintained by the Covenanters with ſtrong Garriſons, and great bodies of Horſe: ſo that except he had a mind utterly to undoe his friends, he had no other place to winter his Souldiers in but that.</hi> And <hi>being preſſed with theſe reaſons, with long and foul journeys, and incredible ſpeed, he commeth into</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle.</p>
               <p>The Earl at that time was liſting ſouldiers in his Country, and had appointed the day and place for a Rendezvouz, He lived ſecurely in the caſtle of <hi>Inncra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> ſuppoſing no enemie to be within a hundred miles of him. For he could never before be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that an Army could get into <hi>Argyle</hi> on foot in the midſt of ſummer, and many times heretofore he has been heard to bragge, that he had rather loſe a hundred thouſand Crowns, than any mortal man ſhould know the way by which an Army could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his Country. When he therefore ſuſpected nothing leſſe, the trembling Cow-herds came down from the hills, and told him the enemy was within two miles. He not knowing what to do, and almoſt beſides himſelf for fear, at laſt commits himſelf to a fiſher-boat, and flies away; leaving his friends, and ſervants, and the whole Countrey to their fortunes, and the mercy of an enemy. It is a rough and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116038:37"/>
countrey, barren of corn, for little or none is ſown there, but very commodious for paſture, the chief riches of the inhabitants conſiſting in cattell. <hi>Montroſe</hi> divides his Army into three Brigades, and ſends them about the countrey; one Brigade was commanded by the chief of the <hi>Mac-renalds,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> and the third by himſelf. They range about all the country, and lay it waſte; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they find in arms going to the Rendezvouz appointed by their Lord, they ſlay, and ſpare no man that was fit for War: nor do they give over till they had driven all ſerviceable men out of that Territory, or at leaſt into holes known to none but themſelves. Then they fire the villages and Cottes, and lay them levell with the ground: in that retaliating <hi>Arygle</hi> with the ſame meaſure he had meted unto others, who was the firſt in all the Kingdome that proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Country-men with fire and ſword. Laſtly, they drive their cattell. Nor did they deal more gently with others who lived in <hi>Lorn,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour parts, that acknowledged <hi>Argyle</hi>'s power. Theſe things laſted from the 13. of <hi>December</hi> 1644. to the 28. or 29. of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
               <p>And indeed, he uſed never more to acknowledge the ſingular providence and fatherly mercy of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, than in bringing him and his men ſafe out of thoſe places; for if but two hundred Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had handſomly kept thoſe Paſſes, they might eaſily either have cut off, or at leaſt driven back all his Forces. Beſide, if the Cow-herds had but dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away their cattell (which they might eaſily have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116038:38"/>
done) in thoſe barren places, he muſt have ſtarved for hunger. Or thirdly if it had been a ſharp and ſtormy winter, (and it ſeldome chances to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there) they had either been drowned in ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drifts, or ſtarv'd and benumb'd with cold. But mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God took away both courage from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and its ordinary temper from the air; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed their want of bread with great abundance of fleſh. At length departing out of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Lorn, Glencow,</hi> and <hi>Logh-Aber,</hi> he came to <hi>Logh-Neſſe.</hi> And now he expected that all the Highlanders, being either frighted with the example of <hi>Argyle,</hi> or freed from the fear of him, ſhould be ready to aſſiſt the Kings moſt righteous cauſe, and vindicate it with their arms againſt the Rebells.</p>
               <p>But now leſt <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s heroical ſpirit ſhould ever want matter to work upon, he is advertiſed that the Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> a very powerfull man in thoſe parts (and one of whom he had entertained a better opinion) with the Garriſon of <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> which were old ſouldiers, and the whole ſtrength of <hi>Murray, Roſſe, Sutherland, Cathnes,</hi> and the ſept of the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> were ready to meet him with a deſperate army of five thouſand Horſe and Foot. <hi>Montroſe</hi> had only fifteen hundred, for thoſe of <hi>Clanrenald,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, ſuſpecting no ſuch need of them, and being laden with the ſpoils of <hi>Argyle,</hi> had got leave to go home, on condition they ſhould return when they were ſent for. But for all that <hi>Montroſe</hi> was not afraid to give battell to that diſorderly Army: for although he knew thoſe of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116038:38"/>
Garriſon to be old ſouldiers, yet he accounted of the reſt of the multitude (which were newly raiſed out of Husbandmen, Cow-herds, Pedees, Tavern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, and Kitchin-boyes) to be altogether raw and unſerviceable.</p>
               <p>And now while he thought of nothing but fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, a truſty Meſſenger overtakes him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms him, that <hi>Argyle</hi> having gathered forces out of the lower parts of the Kingdom, and joyned unto them ſuch Highlanders as yet adhered unto him, had come down into <hi>Logh-Aber</hi> with three thouſand Foot, and ſtaid at an old Caſtle called <hi>Innerlogh,</hi> upon the bank of <hi>Logh-Aber. Montroſe</hi> who well underſtood the crafty and cowardly diſpoſition of <hi>Argyle,</hi> by that had a good gueſſe at his deſigne; which was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after him at a good diſtance, that he might be firſt engaged with thoſe Northern-men, and then to make his own advantage of the event of that battell; but by no means to fight himſelf, if he could help it. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> conſidered that it would be a matter of greater concernment, and of leſſe danger, to let men ſee that <hi>Argyle</hi> was not invincible, even in the Highlands, where he was adored by the ſimple people like ſome great-little god: and as for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Army, he conceived that upon the report of a Victory obtained againſt <hi>Argyle,</hi> it would moulder away, and eaſily be brought into order. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was thirty miles abſent from <hi>Innerlogh,</hi> neither would he go the high way thither (though he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced guards in it, leſt the enemy ſhould have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his moving) but ſtreight over <hi>Logh-Aber</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:116038:39"/>
hills, in untroden paths, and only known to Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Huntſ-men, (for in thoſe mountains there are great herds of Deer) by a way that never man led an Army before; and killing their Scouts, was upon the back of the enemy ere he was aware. They being but little affrighted with ſo unexpected an accident, run to their arms, and immediatly prepare themſelves for battell. When <hi>Montroſe</hi> perceived them to be in a poſture ſo quickly, he ſtood ſtill a little while till his Rear being tired with ſo hard a march could come up unto his Front. It was night, but the Moon ſhone ſo cleerly that it was almoſt as light as day; all night they ſtood to their arms, and making frequent ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and skirmiſhes one with another, neither gave the other leave to reſt or retreat. All others earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected day, only <hi>Argyle</hi> being more adviſed than the reſt conveyed himſelf away at dead of the night; and this ſecond time taking boat ſaved himſelf from the perill of battell, as if he intended to be Umpire between the two Armies, and being himſelf out of gun-ſhot ſtand ſpectatour of other mens valour, and well too. At the break of day, <hi>Montroſe</hi> ordered his men as he intended to fight, and the enemy were as forward to doe the like. For they did not yet think that <hi>Montroſe</hi> was there (as ſome priſoners after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſed) but ſome Collonel or Captain of his with a party only of his forces.</p>
               <p>When the Sun was up, on the ſecond of <hi>February</hi> (which is <hi>Candelmaſs</hi> day) a trumpet ſounding ſtruck no ſmall terrour into the enemy. For beſides that attumpet ſhewed they had Horſe with them,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116038:39"/>
and therefore was a ſound with which thoſe parts were little acquainted, it diſcovered alſo that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> himſelf was there Nevertheleſſe the prime of the <hi>Campbells</hi> (that's the ſirname of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily) being gallant men and ſtout, and deſerving to fight under a better Chieftain in a better cauſe, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begin the battell. But their ſouldiers that were in the Front having only once diſcharged their muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men preſſing on fiercely to come to the dint of ſword, began to run. Whom they, raiſing a great ſhout, ſo eagerly purſued, that as it were at one aſſault they routed them all; and had the killing of them with a moſt horrible ſlaughter for nine miles together. Of the enemy were ſlain fifteen hundred, among whom were very many Gentlemen of the <hi>Campbells,</hi> who were chief men of the family, and of good account in their country, who fighting but too valiantly for their Chieftain, had deaths anſwerable to their names, and fell in <hi>Campobelli,</hi> in the Field of War, <hi>(I cannot ſay the bed of Honour.)</hi> Their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <hi>Montroſe</hi> extremely lamented, and ſaved as many of them as he was able, taking them into his protection; whiles <hi>Argyle</hi> himſelf being gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a boat, and rowed a little way off the ſhore, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely look'd on whiles his kindred and ſouldiers were knockt on the head. Some Colonels and Captains that <hi>Argyle</hi> had brought thither out of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands fled into the Caſtle; whom when the Caſtle was ſurrendred, and quarter was given unto them, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> uſed curteouſly; and after he had done them ſeveral good offices of humanity and charity, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116038:40"/>
let them depart. In this fight <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounded, but none ſlain ſaving three private ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: but the joy of this great victory was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by the wounds of that truly honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Ogilby,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> of which after a few days he dyed. He was one of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s deareſt friends; one who had done very good ſervice for the King in <hi>England</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Father-in-law the Lord <hi>Ruthien</hi> Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Branceforde,</hi> (a man known all the world over for his noble archievements.) Nor was he leſſe a ſcholar than a ſouldier, being a new ornament to the family of the <hi>Ogilbies,</hi> whoſe honourable deaths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounds for his King and Country had no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon that days victory. <hi>Montroſe</hi> being very much afflicted with the loſſe of him, cauſeth his body to be carried into <hi>Athole,</hi> where he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred with as ſumptuous a funeral as that place and thoſe times could afford. But the power of the <hi>Campbells</hi> in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> which for theſe many ages paſt hath been formidable to their neighbours was by this overthrow clearly broken to pieces; and by it alſo a way opened unto <hi>Montroſe</hi> to doe his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe the more eaſily thence forward. For the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers being warlike men, and let looſe from the hated tyranny of <hi>Argyle,</hi> now began to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves willingly unto the Kings ſervice.</p>

               <p>THe ſouldier who was almoſt ſpent with this ſore travell, having refreſhed himſelf for a few dayes, <hi>Montroſe</hi> meaſuring over again <hi>Logh-Aber</hi> hills, returneth to <hi>Logh-Neſſe.</hi> And from thence viewing by the way the coaſts of <hi>Harrick, Arne,</hi> and <hi>Narne,</hi> came to the river of <hi>Spey.</hi> Here he is told, that there was no ſmall party of the enemy at <hi>Elgin,</hi> (which is the chief town of <hi>Murray,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try beyond the <hi>Spey.) Montroſe</hi> hies towards theſe, either to draw them to his ſide, or to ſuppreſſe them: but the very report of his advancing blew away that cloud, for they in great amazement ſhifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every one whither he could. <hi>Montroſe</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe goes on his march, and takes in <hi>Elgin</hi> by ſurrender on the fourteenth day of <hi>February.</hi> At which time the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> eldeſt Sonne to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley,</hi> (a man who can never be ſufficiently commended for his excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) came off openly to the Kings ſide (from his Uncle by whom he had been detained againſt his will) and, with not many but very choiſe friends and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, voluntarily did his duty, and offered his ſervice to <hi>Montroſe</hi> as the Kings Deputy and Vicegerent. <hi>Montroſe</hi> firſt welcomed him with all civility, and gave him many thanks, afterwards, when he came to underſtand him more inwardly, joyned him unto himſelf in the entireſt bonds of friendſhip and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Now becauſe the inhabitants of <hi>Murray</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:116038:41"/>
were extremely addicted to the Covenanters, they hid themſelves in their lurking places, nor were any ſupplies to be expected from men ſo maliciouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; Therfore he drew his Forces to this ſide the <hi>Spey,</hi> to raiſe the Countries of <hi>Bamph</hi> and <hi>Abordeen</hi> by the preſence, example, and authority of the Lord <hi>Gordon.</hi> So having got together what forces he could in thoſe places, with two thouſand Foot and two hundred Horſe, paſſing the river of <hi>Dee</hi> he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Marne,</hi> and encamped not farre from <hi>Fether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Breichin</hi> ſome ſeven miles from thence, Sir <hi>John Hurrey</hi> a ſtout man and an active, and famous alſo in forein parts for Military exploits, being General of the Horſe for the Covenanters, had the Command over the whole Forces there.

turned their backs <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers drive on, let fly, and lay about them, untill being got over the river of <hi>Eske,</hi> the enemy ſcarce ſafe under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Night, betook themſelves to ſhelter: nor did they think themſelves ſecure till after a race of four and twenty miles long they came to <hi>Dundee.</hi> Then they that had purſued them ſo far returned to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thercarne,</hi> and thence the next day to <hi>Breichin.</hi> Here <hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood, that <hi>Baily</hi> a Commander of great account had been fetched out of <hi>England,</hi> to be General of the enemies Forces; that <hi>Hurrey</hi> with his Horſe was joyned unto him, and that they had in their Army many old ſouldiers brought back out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo that now the Covenanters going about their buſineſſe in ſo great ſadneſſe, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> muſt expect not only other kind of ſouldiers, but alſo moſt expert Commanders to deal with.</p>
               <p>Therefore, leſt he ſhould chance to be hemm'd in with their Horſe (in which their chief ſtrength lay) he chuſeth his moſt convenient way by the foot of <hi>Grainsbaine</hi> towards the river of <hi>Tay</hi> intending al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if it were poſſible to get over the <hi>Forth,</hi> where he believed the King could not want aſſiſtance. Which deſigne of his was not unknown to the enemy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſend theſe Commanders againſt him with a powerfull Army; who no ſooner came in ſight than <hi>Montroſe</hi> offered them battell. But they intended nothing leſſe than to try it out with him that way, nor would adventure ſo much as but to fall upon the rear of <hi>Montroſe</hi> as he marched off. So he went to the Caſtle of <hi>Innerwharity,</hi> and the next day to a village
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116038:42"/>
called <hi>Eliot.</hi> And here again leaving the mountains behind him, he deſcends into the plain, and by a Trumpet ſends a challenge unto <hi>Baily</hi> to fight. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two Armies ran the river <hi>Ile,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſafely paſſe over without the others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore deſires <hi>Baily</hi> to give him leave ſafely to come over to that ſide, which motion if <hi>Baily</hi> ſhould not like of, he offered him a ſafe and free paſſage, on condition, that he would engage his honour to fight without further delay. <hi>Baily</hi> anſwered, he would look to his own buſineſſe himſelf, and would not have other men teach him when to fight. Thus the two armies fac'd one another many days, neither the enemy endeavouring to paſſe their Forces over the river againſt <hi>Montroſe,</hi> nor he hoping to make good his paſſe unto them by reaſon of his ſcarcity of Horſe. Marching therefore to <hi>Dunkel,</hi> he thought to paſſe the <hi>Tay,</hi> at which time by a ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected miſchief he was almoſt utterly ruined. It was thus, <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> Son to Marqueſſe <hi>Huntley,</hi> who had born arms againſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> in the battell of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> by the mediation of his noble Brother the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had been received into favour. He either by true or counterfeit letters from the old fox in the hole; his father, tempted and carried away with him almoſt all the <hi>Gordons,</hi> without the knowledge of his Brother; and baſely deſerted <hi>Montroſe</hi> and him, when they were ready to be engaged with the enemy. And truly it is hard to ſay to whether of both he bore leſſe good will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> being ſore afflicted with this unexpected
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116038:42"/>
revolt, although he was of neceſſity to return into the North to gather new Forces, yet made as if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he went ſtraight towards the <hi>Forth;</hi> and his ſcouts came all with full cry, that all the enemy were got over the <hi>Tay,</hi> that by taking the fords of the <hi>Forth</hi> they might hinder his paſſage. He, leſt he ſhould ſeem all this while to have done nothing, thought it well worth his labour, if by the way he could take in <hi>Dundee,</hi> a moſt ſeditious town, for that being the ſecureſt haunt and receptacle of the Rebels in thoſe parts; and a place that had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as much as any other towards the Rebellion, was kept by no other garriſon but of the Townſmen. He therfore commanded the weakeſt and worſt armed men to goe along by the bottom of the hills and to meet him at <hi>Breichin:</hi> and he taking with him what Horſe he had (which were but one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all) and ſix hundred nimble muſquetiers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Dunkel</hi> about twelve of the clock in the night, made ſo great haſte, that he came to <hi>Dundee</hi> by ten of the clock in the morning on the fourth day of <hi>April.</hi> He ſummons the Townſmen to deliver the Town to the King, which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to preſerve their own lives and its ſafety; if they would not, they muſt expect fire and ſword. They began to make delayes, and firſt to give no anſwer at all, afterward to commit the Trumpet to priſon. Which affront provoked <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſo highly, that hee ſtormed the Town in three places at once: The Townſmen ſtood out a while and mantained their works, but they had as good have done no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116038:43"/>
for the Iriſh and Highlanders would take no repulſe, but with a reſolute aſſault ſome beat them out of their ſconces, and poſſeſſing themſelves of their Ordnance turned it againſt the Town; others beat open the gates, and poſſeſſe themſelves of the Church and Market-place, and others ſet the Town on fire in ſeveral places. And indeed had not the common ſouldiers by an unſeaſonable avarice and intemperance addicted themſelves to pillage, that rich Town had been immediately all on fire. But as it happened, it was better both for the conquerours and the conquered that it was not, for all the intelligence that the Scouts had brought in concerning the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming over the <hi>Tay</hi> was abſolutely falſe: it may be they ſaw a few Troops (and many they did not ſee) paſſe over it, which they beleeved to have been the whole body of the enemy, and by that means were like to have undone both themſelves and the whole party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſtood upon the top of a hill cloſe unto <hi>Dundee,</hi> looking upon this onſlaught, when his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breathleſſe Scouts brought him news that <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Hurrey</hi> with three thouſand Foot and eight hundred Horſe were ſcarce a mile off. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately calls his men out of the Town, which he had much to doe to perſwade them; for the ſouldiers counting themſelves ſecure of the victory, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had done a good dayes work already, and beſides being a little heated in drink and much taken with ſo rich a booty, could hardly be brought to leave the Town they had ſo newly taken. And truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116038:43"/>
they could be beaten off from the ſpoil, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was come within musket-ſhot of them. And now (as it uſes to happen in great dangers) <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s counſell of War were of different opinions; ſome perſwaded that <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Horſe he had, becauſe they conceived it not poſſible that he ſhould be able to bring off the Foot, who had been wearied with a march of above twenty miles in the morning, after that, were ſpent in a hot fight at noon, and now were over-loaden either with drink or prey; eſpecially ſeeing he was to march twenty or perhaps thirty miles from <hi>Dundee</hi> before they could reſt in ſafety. That this was the fortune of War, and to be patiently under-gone, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince he had given oft-times far greater o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows to the enemy than this could be to him. That there was no doubt, but that as long as he was ſafe, his Forces might be eaſily recruited; and on the other ſide, if he miſcarried, the caſe was deſperate, and they were utterly undone. Others cryed out, that all was loſt already, and there was nothing left them but to die with honour; and therefore if charging couragiouſly they ſhould break in amongſt the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the enemy, no one could ſay but that they fell gallantly. <hi>Montroſe</hi> concurred with neither of theſe; for he could never be brought to forſake ſo good men as he had in the extremeſt danger, and preferred an honourable death among his ſouldiers, before diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſafety. But for all that, for men that were ſo much out-numbred by them, to run deſperately upon the enemy, and as it were to daſh out their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116038:44"/>
own brains againſt the ſtones, was the very laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and not haſtily to be made uſe of; therefore as we ought not to tempt Almighty God by our own wretchleſneſſe and negligence, ſo neither ought any valiant man or good Chriſtian deſpair of his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a juſt cauſe. Laſtly, he exhorts every one to do his own part, and referre the ſucceſſe to God, and other things to his own care and induſtry.</p>
               <p>Immediately he ſends out four hundred Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and commands them, that as much as they poſſibly could without breaking their ranks they ſhould make all ſpeed. Then he appoints two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the activeſt men he had to follow them; and he with his Horſe brings up the Rear. The Horſe trooped on in ſo open order, that if occaſion were they might have room enough to receive light muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers. He believed the enemies Foot were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overtake them; and if their Horſe only ſhould charge them (which they would hardly adventure to do) he conceived it was no matter of extreme difficulty to make their part good againſt them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Sun was ready to ſet, and the darkneſſe of the night would be commodious for their retreat. The enemy underſtanding the number of them that went away firſt by ſome priſoners they had taken, and after that by their own view, aſſoon as they ſaw they were diſpoſed rather for a journey than a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, divide their Forces into two parts, and ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them. Wherein their intention was not only to fall upon the Rear and the Flank at once, but alſo to ſecure againſt them all paſſages up to the Highlands:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116038:44"/>
And their Commanders the more to encourage their Souldiers to a hot purſute, propoſed twenty thouſand Crowns to any one that could bring in <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s head. And now the Van of the enemies Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cloze up unto the retreaters, whereupon thoſe good muſquetiers that lined <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed one, and another, and another of the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them with bullets in their ſides; with whoſe miſchance the reſt becoming more wary, abated of the eagerneſſe of their purſute. And <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers when they ſaw they had been too hard for the enemies Foot at a march, and had got before them, taking heart and courage they skirmiſhed ſtoutly with their Horſe, untill the night parted the quarrell. And to rid themſelves ſome way of the enemy, took their way Eaſt-ward many miles by the ſea-coaſt. However that was not their way, but to go North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward <hi>Grainsbain,</hi> and ſo to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their miſchievous Horſe. But <hi>Baily</hi> had laid the greateſt part of his Army between them and <hi>Grainsbain,</hi> that there might be no place for them to retreat unto.</p>
               <p>Therefore at the dead of the night when they were not far from <hi>Aberbroth, Montroſe</hi> commands his men to make a ſtand a while. And long they ſtood not, before he conſidering with himſelf that all wayes and paſſages ſtraight into the Mountains might be laid by the enemies Horſe (and he was not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,) commands them to face about, and march South-weſt. And by this art (though with intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pains) he beguiled the Purſuers, whom that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116038:45"/>
ſame night he paſſed by; and then turning North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the next morning at Sunriſing paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>South-Eske</hi> at a place not far from <hi>Careſton</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: and from thence ſent to <hi>Breichin</hi> to fetch thoſe men which he had there with the Carriages. But that had not needed, for they upon the report of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition had provided for themſelves better &amp; more timely, and had taken the Mountains. VVhiles he ſtaid at <hi>Careſton,</hi> the Scouts brought him word on a ſudden that the enemies Horſe were in ſight, and their Foot being refreſht with victualls and ſleep march'd after them apace. <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf being now within three miles of the Mountains was not much afraid of them, but his ſouldiers who had not ſlept for three dayes and two nights, but had all that while been either on their march, or in fight, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſo dead ſleep, that they could hardly be raiſed without pricks and wounds. The enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt entertained with a light skirmiſh ſuffered <hi>Montroſe</hi> to poſſeſſe himſelf of the bottome of the Mountains, and having done nothing to the purpoſe retreated from their vain purſute. So he and his men came to <hi>Gleneske.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was that ſo much talk'd-of Expedition of <hi>Dundee,</hi> infamous indeed for the miſtake of the Scouts, but as renowned as any for the valour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and undaunted reſolution of the General: and even admirable for the hardineſſe of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in encountering all extremities with patience; for threeſcore miles together they had been often in fight, alwayes upon their march, without either meat,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116038:45"/>
or ſleep, or the leaſt refreſhment. Which whether forein Nations or after times will believe, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but I am ſure I deliver nothing but what is moſt certain of mine own knowledge. And truly amongſt expert Souldiers, and thoſe of eminent note both in <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> I have not ſeldome heard this Expedition of his preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s greateſt victories.</p>

               <p>ANd now being ſafe beyond expectation, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> bids the ſouldiers take their reſt, whiles he determines thus of the whole affair of the War. He ſends the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> together with thoſe that had continued loyal and dutifull after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of his brother <hi>Lewis,</hi> into their own Country, both that they might recall thoſe whom his Brother had ſeduced away, and recruit themſelves by levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new forces. Which he cheerfully and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly performed, and though he ſpared none, yet he was moſt ſevere with thoſe that had been authors or acceſſaries to his Brothers defection: and he was the more active in that buſineſſe, that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf of any ſuſpition. Nor indeed did <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> himſelf or any other more deteſt that villany of <hi>Lewis Gordon,</hi> than that noble Lord his Brother. As for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> he with a ſmall party (for he kept but five hundred Foot and fifty Horſe with him) marches through <hi>Angus</hi> into <hi>Perthſhire,</hi> that he might diſtract the enemy till ſuch time as he had made up his Army
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116038:46"/>
with recrutes from every ſide. Neither was he out in his aim, for the Covenanters had ſent <hi>Hurrey</hi> the Lieutenant General of the Horſe, with a Command into the North, of a party of ſix hundred old Foot, and two hundred Horſe; that he might ſtrengthen their own-ſide, and ſuppreſſe the Lord <hi>Gordon.</hi> And <hi>Baily</hi> himſelf ſtaid with an Army at <hi>Perth,</hi> as in the very heart of the Kingdom, ready to wait upon all motions. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was twelve miles off at a village called <hi>Kreif,</hi> where <hi>Baily</hi> underſtood he quartered ſecurely with a very ſmall party: who being diligent upon all occaſions, ſet out from <hi>Beth</hi> at the beginning of the night with all his Army, that by a ſpeedy march he might at break of day fall unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected into <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s quarters. But he found <hi>Montroſe</hi> carefull enough of his buſineſſe, and his Foot ready in arms either to march or fight; but he with his Horſe came up towards the enemy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their number and ſtrength. And when he found them to be two thouſand Foot and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, he commanded his men to march ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily away, and following the courſe of the river <hi>Erne</hi> to make good the fords thereof: he with the few Horſe that he had was their Rear-guard, leſt they ſhould have been troden in pieces by the enemies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. And truly he ſo valiantly repulſed the fierce aſſault of the enemy, that by killing ſome, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, he forced them to retreat, till at laſt his Foot after ſix miles march had made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the paſſes of <hi>Erne.</hi> So the enemy retreated with the loſſe of their labour, and <hi>Montroſe</hi> that

ſame night being the eighteenth of <hi>April,</hi> quartered at <hi>Logh-Erne,</hi> and came the next day to <hi>Balwider,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Alboine</hi> met him, who with ſome few more had eſcaped out of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and hearing tydings of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s good ſucceſſe, had at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his Country.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Balwidir</hi> they advanced to <hi>Logh-Catri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> where they receive intelligence that <hi>Hurrey</hi> had raiſed great forces in the North, and was ready to engage with the Lord <hi>Gordon;</hi> and therefore there was danger that he being an active Souldier and a good Commander ſhould be able to over-maſter that gallant young Gentleman. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> thought it neceſſary to oppoſe. <hi>Hurrey</hi> aſſoon as was poſſible, as well to ſecure ſo dear a friend from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, as to be nibbling at the enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as he found them aſunder, and to cut off that power by peece-meal, which he well knew if it were all in a body would be above his match. Therefore by long and continued journeys paſſing by <hi>Balwidir,</hi> and a Lake of four and twenty miles long, out of which the river of <hi>Tay</hi> breaks forth, through <hi>Athole</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> and over <hi>Grainsbain,</hi> through a vale called <hi>Glenmuck,</hi> he came to the midſt of <hi>Marre.</hi> There he joyned with the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> who had now a thouſand Foot, and two Hundred Horſe, and marching ſtraight to the <hi>Spey,</hi> laboured to find out and engage with the enemy.

               </p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Montroſe</hi> incamped at a village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alderne:</hi> and <hi>Hurrey</hi> according to his hopes found the Earls of <hi>Seaforth</hi> and <hi>Suherland,</hi> the whole ſept of the <hi>Fraſers,</hi> and moſt of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and the neighbouring parts, to have aſſembled themſelves to <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> well appointed. To theſe <hi>Hurrey</hi> ads ſom old ſouldiers of the Garriſon of that Town, and ſo draws up againſt <hi>Montroſe.</hi> He now commanded three thouſand and five hundred Foot, &amp; four hundred Horſe; but <hi>Montroſe</hi> (who had no more but fifteen hundred Foot and two hundred Horſe) had a great mind to retire. But not only <hi>Hurrey</hi> preſſed ſo vehemently upon him, that it was ſcarce poſſible for him to retreat, But <hi>Baily</hi> alſo with a Southern Army much ſtronger than <hi>Hurrey</hi>'s (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in Horſe) was now got already a great way on that ſide <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> and marched in great haſte towards the <hi>Spey.</hi> What ſhould <hi>Montroſe</hi> doe in this condition? He muſt of neceſſity either give <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:116038:47"/>
battell, or undergoe a far greater hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hemm'd in between two Armies. Therfore he reſolves to try the fortune of War without delay, to commit the ſucceſſe unto God, and chuſing the beſt advantage of ground he could find, there to expect the aſſault of the enemy. There was a litle Town that ſtood upon the height which ſhadowed the neighbouring valley; and ſome little hills that were higher than the Town behind it, that hindered the diſcovery of any one till they were juſt upon him. In this valley he drawes up his Forces out of the view of the enemy. Before the Town he places a few but expert and choice Foot with his Ordnance, who were ſheltered with ſuch ditches as they found there. The right wing he commits to <hi>Alexander Mac-donald</hi> with four hundred Foot, and lodged them in places fortified to their hand with banks and ditches, with ſhrubs alſo and great ſtones: and commands him to preſerve himſelf entire that he might be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon all occaſions, and not to depart from his ſtation which had ſo good a naturall fence, that they might lie there ſafe enough not only from the enemies Horſe but Foot alſo. And with the ſame good advice he committed to his charge that notable Standard of the Kings, which only he was wont to carry before him; expecting that the enemy upon the ſight of that would order the beſt of their Forces againſt that wing, which by reaſon of the diſadvantage of the place would be rendred wholly unuſefull unto them, till ſuch time as he on the flank ſhould take his beſt advantage againſt them. And to that end draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116038:48"/>
the reſt of his Forces to the other ſide, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Horſe to the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> and takes charge of the Foot himſelf. Thoſe few that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town under the ſhelter and convert of the banks and ditches ſeemed as if they were his main battel, whereas indeed he had none. And for Reſerves in that ſcarcity of men they were not to be thought of.</p>
               <p>The enemy (as <hi>Montroſe</hi> moſt wiſely fore-ſaw) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they ſaw the Kings Standard, ordered the moſt part of their Horſe and old Souldiers (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their chief ſtrength conſiſted) againſt that. And by this time the Van of the enemy began to diſpute it with thoſe before the Town, and on the right flank, and ſtill as their Souldiers were ſpent, drew up freſh men; which <hi>Montroſe</hi> becauſe his number was but few could not ſo eaſily doe: therefore he reſolved with all his men that he had on the left flank to make a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſault upon the enemy at once. And whiles he was thinking ſo to do, there comes unto him one whom he knew to be truſty and diſcreet, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers him in the ear, that <hi>Mac-donald</hi> with his men on the right flank were put to flight. He being a man of a quick ſpirit, thought it was beſt to fore-ſtall the Souldiers, leſt their hearts ſhould fail them upon bad news, and cryes aloud to the Lord <hi>Gordon, My Lord, what do we do?</hi> Mac-donald <hi>upon the right hand ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving routed and diſcomfited the enemy is upon the execution; ſhall we ſtand by as idle ſpectatours, whiles he carries away the honour of the day?</hi> And with that he commands them to charge. <hi>Hurrey</hi>'s Horſe had no mind long to endure the ſhock of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116038:48"/>
the <hi>Gordons,</hi> but wheeling about and beginning to run, left their flanks (which they were to maintain) open to their enemies. Their Foot, although thus deſerted by their Horſe, being both more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and better armed than <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s men, ſtood out very ſtoutly as long as his men kept aloof; but aſſoon as he came to fall upon them hand to hand, he drove them to throw away their arms, and to ſeek though, to little purpoſe, to ſave themſelves by their heels. But <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf, not forgetting what was ſignified unto him by ſo faithfull a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, drew off with a few of his readieſt men unto the right flank, where he found things in a far other condition than they were left.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Mac-donald</hi> being a valiant man, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his hands then head, (being over-haſty in battel, and bold even to raſhneſſe) diſdaining to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf behind hedges and ſhrubs whiles the enemy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poured and provoked him with ill language, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to orders, upon his own head advanceth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enemy, out of that moſt defenſible faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſtation wherein he was placed. And he did it to his coſt, for the enemy over-powring him both in Horſe and Foot, and having many old ſouldiers amongſt them, routed and repulſed his men. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he had not timely drawn them off into a cloſe hard by, they had every one of them together with the Kings Standard been loſt. But he made a mends for that raſh miſtake, in his admirable courage in bringing off his men, for he was the laſt man that came off, and covering his body with a great target
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116038:49"/>
which he carried in his left hand, defended himſelf againſt the thickeſt of his enemies. Thoſe that came cloſeſt up unto him were Pike-men, who with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a blow had ſtruck their ſpear-heads into his tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, which he cut off by three or foure at once with his ſword, which he managed with his right hand. And thoſe that made him any oppoſition in the cloſe, ſeeing <hi>Montroſe</hi> come in to his aid, and their own men on the other ſide put to flight, ſuch as were Horſe ſpurr'd away, and the Foot (moſt of which were old Souldiers out of <hi>Ireland)</hi> fighting deſperately, were almoſt all of them ſlain upon the ground. The Conquerors purſued them that fled for ſome miles; ſo that there were ſlain about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot of the enemy, amongſt whom their old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fought moſt ſtoutly; but almoſt all their Horſe eſcaped by a more timely than honourable flight.</p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>Hurrey</hi> himſelf with ſome of their beſt men which went laſt off the field eſcaped the hands of the purſuers, had not the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> by I know not what want of heed, diſplayed ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and Standards that had been taken from the enemy; and himſelf not following the chaſe but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards his owne party, ſeemed to have been the enemy, and to threaten a new battell. With which miſtake they were ſo long deluded, untill the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe, though much diſordered, had ſhifted themſelves away into ſuch by-paths as they knew or could light upon: only a few of them came with <hi>Hurrey</hi> before next morning to <hi>Innerneſſe.</hi> Of ſuch of the enemy as were ſlain, the moſt notable were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116038:49"/>
                  <hi>Cambell Laver</hi> a Collonel of old Souldiers, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> and Sir <hi>Gideon Murray</hi> Knights, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtout men, and perhaps not unworthy to be lamented, had they not ſtained their otherwiſe commendable valour with the horrid crime of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; nor in that did they ſo much follow their own judgements as the humour of the times, or the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a varice of their Chiefs. <hi>Montroſe</hi> of thoſe that ſerved with him on the left flank miſſed only one man, and him a private Souldier; and on that ſide where <hi>Mac-donald</hi> commanded, there were miſſing fourteen private Souldiers alſo. But he had many more wounded, the curing and ſecuring of whom was eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provided for by <hi>Montroſe.</hi> Afterwards entertaining the priſoners with ſweetneſſe and courteſie, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all ſuch as repented of their errour, liberty or employment, and was as good as his word, and ſuch as were obſtinate in their rebellion he diſpoſed of into ſeveral priſons. In this battel at <hi>Alderne</hi> the valour of young <hi>Napier</hi> did very much diſcover it ſelf; who being the Son of the Lord <hi>Napier</hi> of <hi>Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s nephew by his ſiſter, had but a little before, without the knowledge of his Father, or Wife, ſtoln away from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his Uncle, and did at this time give an excellent aſſay of his valour, and laid down moſt firm principles of a moſt noble diſpoſition. Whereupon the chief of the Covenanters took his Father, a man almoſt threeſcore and ten years old (and as good a man as ever <hi>Scotland</hi> bred in this age,) and his wife, the daughter of the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> Sir <hi>Sterling Keer</hi> his brother-in-law (an excellent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116038:50"/>
man alſo, chief of his family, and one that had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much for his Loyalty) together with his two ſiſters, the one Sir <hi>Sterlings</hi> moſt vertuous Lady, the other a virgin, and caſt them all into the dungeon; from whence afterward they were to be delivered by <hi>Napier</hi> himſelf with the aſſiſtance of his Uncle.</p>
               <p>This battell was fought at <hi>Alderne</hi> on the 4. of <hi>May,</hi> 1645.</p>

                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> allowing a few dayes of refreſhment to his Souldiers, marched to <hi>Elgin,</hi> which is the chief Town of the Province; where for the ſake of thoſe that were wounded, he made ſome long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtay, becauſe they had there the accommodation of good Chirurgeons and medicines, which are ſome times ſcarce to be had in the field. Afterward paſſing over the <hi>Spey</hi> he came to <hi>Keith,</hi> from thence to <hi>Frendrackt,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Strathbogy.</hi> Here <hi>Baily</hi> meets him (unto whom <hi>Hurrey</hi> with thoſe that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his broken Troops at <hi>Alderne</hi> was joyned) and provokes him to battell. <hi>Montroſe</hi> kept back his men, who were ſpent with great travail, and were far fewer both in Horſe and Foot, though very eager to fight, till ſuch time as he had raiſed new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and recruited them. Therefore thinking it enough to maintain the ground which he had choſen, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly as he could for himſelf untill night, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>Balveny,</hi> whither alſo the enemy follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: but he paſſing by <hi>Strath-Done,</hi> and <hi>Sprath-Spey,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:116038:50"/>
went up to <hi>Badenoth.</hi> The enemy getting to the other ſide of the water provokes him again to fight; but in vain, for he was very wary of giving them a ſet battell, but nevertheleſſe by frequent skirmiſhes, and eſpecially beating up quarters in the night, did ſo much weaken their power and courage, that they that were ſo haughtily daring but a while ago, as well Commanders as Souldiers, haſtily and diſorderly betook themſelves by night to <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> when none purſued them. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that he was ſo rid of his enemy, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for this reaſon; the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the prime ringleader of the Covenanters next unto <hi>Argyle,</hi> and his rivall too (as being brother-in-law to Duke <hi>Hamilton)</hi> uſed to give out, that <hi>Argyle</hi> wanted either care or courage; and howſoever it came to paſſe, was ſtill unfortunate. And therefore he took upon himſelf the command of that Army which was newly raiſed, as if he would aſſay to manage the buſineſſe with better conduct. And now he had paſſed over with his forces into <hi>Angus,</hi> intending to be a Reſerve unto <hi>Baily;</hi> and if any thing ſhould happen othewiſe than well, at the worſt he was ready to hinder <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s paſſage over <hi>Forth.</hi> For they were alwayes very jealous leſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould remove the ſent of Warr to this ſide the <hi>Forth,</hi> and nearer <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Therefore he reſolved with all ſpeed to quell <hi>Lindſey</hi> (who lay yet in <hi>Angus</hi> at a Caſtle called <hi>Newtill)</hi> both becauſe the General was no ſouldier, and the ſouldiers raw, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the hardſhip of Warr.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:116038:51"/>
In purſute of which deſign, departing from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denoth,</hi> he marcheth through the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> over <hi>Gransbain,</hi> and came by long and painfull jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies unto the coaſt of the river of <hi>Airley,</hi> intending to ſurpriſe the enemy on a ſudden: which was eaſie to be done, for he had made ſuch haſte, that the news of his approach was not ſo ſwift as himſelf. And now <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> was not above ſeven miles from him, and all things were ready for an aſſault, when (upon what occaſion it is uncertain) almoſt all the Northern men privatly ran away from their colours, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the way that they came, return into their Country. The Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was in the Camp, and there was none there that deteſted that villany with greater indignation than he, in ſo much that <hi>Montroſe</hi> had much adoe to with-hold him from putting ſuch of the fugitives to death as had any dependence upon him. Some ſtick not to ſay, that theſe men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled away by the private directions of his father the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> who by reaſon of his ſickneſſe was abſent. For it vext <hi>Huntley,</hi> a haughty and envious man, to hear of the ſucceſſe of <hi>Montroſe;</hi> nor could he endure that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward friendſhip which was between his eldeſt ſon and him. However it was, <hi>Montroſe</hi> being caſt down with this unexpected miſfortune, was forced to put off that Expedition againſt <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and to ſuffer patiently ſo great and eaſie a victory to be taken out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Therfore taking up new reſolutions, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> a valiant man and a truſty, and welbeloved in his Country, whom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116038:51"/>
he had ſent before. And by this time <hi>Baily</hi> and <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> had returned from <hi>Innerneſſe,</hi> and quartered in lower <hi>Marre</hi> by the ſide of <hi>Dee.</hi> And <hi>Montroſe</hi> came by the coaſts of <hi>Eske,</hi> and the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> into the heart of that Country, commonly called <hi>Cromarre.</hi> And whiles he paſſed through thoſe plains aforeſaid, he diſpatched <hi>Mac-donald</hi> with a party into the furtheſt part of the Highlands, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſuch Forces as were there raiſed, with all ſpeed unto the Army. Afterward he ſent away the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> himſelf, to haſten and promote that levy of men which <hi>Nathaniel Gordon</hi> was liſting, by all the power and intereſts he had in thoſe parts. Which he moſt diligently performed, and amongſt others, brought his Brother the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> back with him. Whileſt theſe things paſſed in <hi>Cromarre, Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> joynes his Forces with <hi>Baily</hi> in lower <hi>Marre,</hi> with whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> finding himſelf unable to deal, (the moſt part of his Forces being gone along with the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> and <hi>Mac-donald)</hi> he ſtept aſide to the ruinated Caſtle of <hi>Kargarf,</hi> leſt the enemy ſhould overlay him on the champain grounds with their multitudes both of Horſe and Foot; but when he was cloſe unto the Mountains he feared them not. From hence <hi>Aboine</hi> falling ſick again betook himſelf to <hi>Strathbogy;</hi> and upon pretence of a guard, carried along with him a conſiderable number of Horſe, whom his Brother the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had much adoe afterward to draw back to their colours. In the mean time <hi>Lindſey</hi> took a thouſand old Souldiers from <hi>Baily,</hi> and gave him as many raw and new rais'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116038:52"/>
men for them; and as if he intended to doe ſome famous exploit, returning through <hi>Merne</hi> into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> with all the pains he took he did only this, he ranged with his Army up and down <hi>Athole,</hi> and after he had robbed and ſpoiled all the Country, he ſet it on fire. In this imitating <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was the firſt that in this age introduced that cruel and dreadful preſident of deſtroying houſes and corn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Baily</hi> at that time went to <hi>Bogy,</hi> to beſiege the faireſt caſtle that belonged to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and indeed of all the North; and in caſe he failed to take it in, to waſte and fire all the Country of the <hi>Gordons</hi> there-abouts. <hi>Montroſe</hi> (although <hi>Mac-donald</hi> was abſent with a great party) thought it neceſſary to relieve <hi>Huntley</hi> and his friends, whom he laboured to aſſure unto himſelf by all good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and hied thither. Where having notice that <hi>Baily</hi>'s ſouldiers, though not all, yet a great part, were new rais'd men (for he had parted with ſo many old ſouldiers to <hi>Lindſey)</hi> deſired nothing more than without delay to fight him, and marcheth ſtraight towards him. He had not gone above three miles before he diſcovered the enemies Scouts: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent, before ſome of his readieſt men that knew the wayes, to view the ſtrength, the rendezvouz, and the order of the enemy. They immediately bring word that the Foot ſtood on the top of a hill ſome two miles off; and the Horſe had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a narrow and troubleſome paſſe which lay
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116038:52"/>
almoſt in the middle between the two Armies, and were come on this ſide it. Againſt them <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſent ſuch Horſe as he had in a readineſſe, with ſome nimble Firelocks, whom they firſt entertained with light skirmiſhes afarre off, and after retreated behind the paſſe, which they had ſtrongly mann'd with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers. <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſends for the Foot, that if it were poſſible they might diſlodge the enemy from thence; but it could not be done, for they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the fall of the night, which both ſides paſſed over, waking and in their arms. The next day <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſends a Trumpet to offer a ſet battell, but <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> anſwers, he would not receive order to fight from an enemy. He therefore ſeeing he could not drive the enemy from thoſe paſſes without manifeſt loſſe and danger, that he might draw him out thence in ſome time, marcheth off to <hi>Pitlurge,</hi> and from thence to a Caſtle of the Lord <hi>Forbeſes</hi> called <hi>Druminore,</hi> where he ſtaid two dayes. And at laſt he underſtands the enemy had quitted the paſſes, and was marching toward <hi>Strathbogy;</hi> ſo he at break of day ſets forth towards a village called <hi>Alford.</hi> But <hi>Baily</hi> when he had gotten certain notice that <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> with a conſiderable part of thoſe Forces, was abſent in the Highlands, he voluntarily purſues <hi>Montroſe,</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to be ſtealing away, and about noon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to face him. <hi>Montroſe</hi> determines to wait for the enemy (who as ſeemed to him came towards him) upon the higher ground: but <hi>Baily</hi> turning aſide ſome three miles to the left hand, <hi>Montroſe</hi> holds on his intended march to <hi>Alford,</hi> where he ſtaid that night,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116038:53"/>
the enemy lying about four miles off.</p>
               <p>The next day after, <hi>Montroſe</hi> commands his men very early in the morning to ſtand to their arms, and make ready to battell, and placed them on a hill that ſtands over <hi>Alford.</hi> And as he with a Troop of Horſe was obſerving the motion and order of the enemy, and viewing the fords of the <hi>Done,</hi> a river which runs by <hi>Alford,</hi> it was told him, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Horſe and Foot, were making unto a ford which lay a mile from <hi>Alford,</hi> to the intent that they might cut off the Rear of their flying enemy; for ſo thoſe excellent Diviners propheſied to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Montroſe</hi> leaving that Troop of Horſe not farre from the Ford, together with ſome ſelect and underſtanding men, who ſhould give him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intelligence of all things, he returneth alone to order the battel. And above all things he poſſeſſes himſelf of <hi>Alford</hi> hill, where he might receive the charge of the enemy if they fell on deſperately. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him was a mooriſh place full of ditches and pits, which would prevent Horſe falling upon his Rear: befote him was a ſteep hill, which kept his men from the enemies view, ſo that they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive the formoſt ranks. He had ſcarce given order for the right managing of all things, when thoſe Horſe, whom he had left at the Ford, returned with a full cariere, and bring word that the enemy had paſſed the River. And novv it vvas no more ſafe for either of them to retreat vvithout the apparent ruine of their party. It is reported, that <hi>Baily</hi> like a skilful and vvary Commander, vvas ſore againſt his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116038:53"/>
will drawn unto this battel; nor had engaged, had he not been neceſſitated unto it by the raſhneſſe of the Lord <hi>Balcariſe,</hi> a Collonel of Horſe; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated himſelf and the Horſe under his command into that danger, whether <hi>Baily</hi> would or no, as that he could not be brought off without the hazard of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> gave the command of his right wing (on which ſide the enemies Horſe were moſt ſtrong) unto the Lord <hi>Gordon;</hi> and appointed <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> an old Commander to his aſſiſtance. The command of the left wing was given to the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> to whom alſo was joyned Sir <hi>William Rollock:</hi> And of the main battel to two valiant men, <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and <hi>Drumond</hi> of <hi>Ball</hi> the younger, unto whom he added <hi>George Graham</hi> Maſter of the Camp, an expert Souldier alſo. The Reſerve, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hid behind the hill, was commanded by his Nephew <hi>Napier.</hi> And for a while, <hi>Montroſe</hi> kept himſelf upon the height, and the enemy in the valley being fortified with pits and ditches; for it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafe for the latter to charge up the hill, nor for the former to fall upon them that were ſurrounded with marſhes and pooles. The numbers of the Foot were in a manner even, either ſide had about two thouſand: but <hi>Baily</hi> was much ſtronger in Horſe, for he had ſix hundred, and <hi>Montroſe</hi> but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty. Only <hi>Montroſe</hi> had this advantage, that the enemy were for the moſt part hirelings rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from dunghils, but thoſe that ſerved the King, Gentlemen, who fought for a good Cauſe and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116038:54"/>
Honour, <hi>gratis,</hi> and not for gain; and ſuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd it more becoming to die than to be overcome. Beſides, <hi>Montroſe</hi> knew that the greateſt part of the old Souldiers were gone with <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the new ones would be ſo frighted with the ſhouts of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the noiſe of Trumpets, that they would ſcarce ſtand the firſt charge. Therefore in confidence of ſo juſt a cauſe, and ſo valiant aſſertors of it, he firſt drew down his men, and immediately the Lord <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> giving a ſmart charge upon them, was courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiv'd by the enemy, who truſted to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Horſe: and now being clos'd, and come to handy-blows, no one could advance a foot but over his vanquiſhed enemy; nor retreat by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the preſſing on of thoſe in the Rear. The firſt that made way for themſelves and their men by a great ſlaughter of their enemies were the two <hi>Gordons,</hi> the Lord, and the Collonel; and Collonel <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> called out unto thoſe expert Firelocks who now lin'd the Horſe as they were wont, <hi>Come on, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſouldiers, throw down your now uſeleſs guns, draw your ſwords, and ſheath them in the Rebels Horſe, or hamſtring them.</hi> They inſtantly took the word of command, and at the ſame time <hi>Montroſe</hi> drawes up <hi>Napier</hi> with his Reſerve, which lay out of ſight on the other ſide of the hill; at whoſe ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected coming, the enemy affrighted betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his heels. <hi>Aboine</hi> with the left wing kept off, nor did he attempt the enemy but by light skirmiſhes in ſmall parties: who when they ſaw their own men on their left wing routed and put to flight, made
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116038:54"/>
their retreat with little loſſe. There Foot being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by their Horſe, after they had deſperately ſtood out a while, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſed quarter, were almoſt all cut off. The fall of the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was no little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the eſcape of their Horſe, who after the battel was won, ruſhing fiercely into the thickeſt of them, received a ſhot thorow his body by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and flying enemy, and fell down dead. Whom alſo <hi>Aboine</hi> did not hotly purſue, being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the loſſe of his brother.</p>
               <p>In this battel, <hi>Montroſe</hi> did not loſe ſo much as one common Souldier, and of Gentlemen, one <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol,</hi> and one <hi>Melton;</hi> whoſe names and families I ſhould moſt willingly have inſerted, had I been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to have knowledge of them, becauſe they died gallantly in the bed of Honour; fighting for their King, their Liberty, and the Laws. Nor are ſome Pedees, as well Scotch as Iriſh, to be forgotten, boyes ſcarce fourteen yeares of age apiece, who throwing down their Maſters luggage, and mounting upon their Nags and Sumpter-horſes, did not only make a fair appearance of a body of Horſe, but (as if they had been Corrivals in valour with their Maſters) beyond what might be expected from their years and ſtrength, fell in among the thickeſt of their enemies. Of whom ſome, but very few, were ſlain; nor did they ſell their lives for nothing; and by that they gave an ample teſtimony of their towardneſſe, and of ſo manly a ſpirit in children as might preſcribe to riper years. But the loſſe of the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had ſo deep an impreſſion upon all mens affections, that they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116038:55"/>
had the face rather of a defeated than victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The firſt ſcene of their ſorrow was acted in a dull ſilence; in the next, the floud-gates were broke open, and the Army was full of ſighes, and ſobs, and wailing, and lamentation; and then with bedewed cheeks, as ſoon as their grief could get a tongue, they blam'd Heaven, and Earth, and Fortune, and every thing, for depriving the King, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Age, themſelves, and their poſterity of ſuch a man. Thus forgetting their victory, and the ſpoil, they fixt their eyes upon the lifeleſs body, kiſſed his face, and hands, commended the ſingular beauty of the Corps, compared the Nobility of his deſcent, and the plentifulneſſe of his fortune, with the hopefulneſſe of his parts; and counted that an unfortunate victory that had ſtood them in ſo much. And truly, it was like to have happened, that their exceſſive ſorrow for the loſſe of this noble Gentleman had conquer'd the Conquerors, had they not comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with the preſence and ſafety of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe.</hi> Nor could he himſelf refrain himſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing with ſalt tears the ſad and bitter fate of his moſt dear and only friend, but lamented much that the honour of his Nation, the ornament of the Scotiſh Nobility, the ableſt aſſertor of the Royal Authority in the North, and ſo intimate a friend unto himſelf, ſhould be thus cut off in the flower of his age. In the mean time, hoping that reaſon and time between them would aſſwage that grief, he commands Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to embalm his noble Corps, which afterwards being removed to <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> he ſaw brought forth

                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> that ſame afternoon that he had got this victory at <hi>Alford,</hi> marching to <hi>Clunie</hi> Caſtle, allowed only two or three hours to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for their refreſhment. And going from thence to the bank of the river <hi>Dee,</hi> ſent away the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> who ſucceeded his deceaſed Brother, into <hi>Buchanſhire,</hi> and the places adjacent for recruits; for many of them who were at the fight being Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not farre from their own habitations, had dropt home with their pillage. And becauſe <hi>Mac-donald</hi> was not yet returned, he kept his quarters at <hi>Cragſton,</hi> expecting both him and <hi>Aboine.</hi> But when he perceived thoſe Auxiliaries were diſpatched unto him with leſſe ſpeed than he hoped, and finding his expectation deluded, impatient of ſo long and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous delay; after he had got over the <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> fell down into <hi>Merne,</hi> and lay at <hi>Fordón</hi> Chapel, once famous for the See and Sepulchre of St. <hi>Palladius.</hi> Thence he ſends to the Earle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boine</hi> (who was now come to <hi>Aberdeen)</hi> to haſten unto him into <hi>Merne</hi> with ſuch Forces as he heard he had raiſed, <hi>Alboine</hi> came indeed, but brought no great ſtore of Forces along with him; therefore he ſends him back into the North to raiſe as many men as he

He himſelf going through <hi>Angus</hi> met his Coſen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> with his <hi>Athole-</hi>men ready to live and die under his command, and <hi>Mac-donald</hi> with a great power of Highlanders: with him was <hi>Macklen</hi> the chief of his ſept, a valiant man, and ſingularly loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, who brought ſome ſeven hundred choice Foot of his Friends and Clients.

But becauſe he dayly expected <hi>Aboine</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> to come unto him with a conſiderable party of Horſe, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over the <hi>Tay</hi> at <hi>Dunkel,</hi> and lying near <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munde,</hi> ſtruck no ſmall terrour into the enemy who held Saint <hi>Johns-town;</hi> and from thence approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer unto them, he encamped in <hi>Methfyn</hi> Foreſt.</p>
               <p>The enemies Foot (all but the Garriſon Souldiers in the Town) lay on the South of the River <hi>Erne.</hi> The Horſe which were deſigned for the guard of the Town and Parliament, as ſoon as they diſcovered <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Scouts, bring in a hot alarm that he was there, and come already cloſe to the gates, and no queſtion but he meant preſently to ſcale the walls, and make an aſſault upon the Town: therefore they were earneſt with the Nobility and the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to ſecure themſelves by a ſpeedy flight: when all this while <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſcarce a hundred Horſe, and they were four hundred. But he the next day the more to encreaſe thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe the enemy kept themſelves within the gates, forthwith turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Duplin,</hi> he diligently view'd this ſide of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116038:57"/>
the River <hi>Erne</hi> and all that coaſt, as if he had Horſe enough to keep all that Countrey in ſubjection. And truly thus much he got by it, that the enemy took him to be exceeding ſtrong as well in Horſe as Foot. Therefore they draw together as many Forces from all ſides as they could make, whom they intended to fight with <hi>Montroſe</hi> if he ſhould offer to paſſe over the <hi>Forth.</hi> But he finding it not ſafe for himſelf nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſcend into the Champain Countrey, they both kept their ſtations for many dayes, the enemy expecting Auxiliaries out of <hi>Fife,</hi> and the Country on this ſide of the <hi>Forth,</hi> and out of the Weſt; and <hi>Montroſe</hi> looking for the like out of the North; And waiting impatiently for <hi>Aboine,</hi> who was too ſlow with his men, he ſent ſome to haſten him, leſt they ſhould loſe the opportunity of doing their buſineſſe. He alſo complained, but in a ſoft and gentle manner, as before a faithfull friend, that <hi>Aboine</hi>'s lingring and delay was in the fault, that a brave victory, by which he conceived the Rebells might have been utterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued had ſlipt out of his hands; which misfortune no man doubted but his ſpeed and diligence might have prevented.</p>
               <p>The enemy when they underſtood that he onely cheated them with a falſe Muſter of Horſe, having gotten aid from all parts, and by this time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbring him even in Foot, labour'd not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, but even compell him to-fight. Whereupon he concluded to ſtep aſide a little into the neighbouring Mountains, whither he knew either the enemy would not advance, or if they did, it would be to their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116038:57"/>
loſſe. Therefore the enemy drawing near with all their Army to <hi>Methfyn,</hi> he gives a private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the Carriages to drive faſt up the hills, whiles he, as if he intended to fight, orders the battell, makes good the paſſes with ſtrong guards, and draws up the Horſe into the Front. Nor did the enemy expect any other than to try it out by battail, which he made as if he would give, till ſuch time as the Carriages were got ſo far before, that he conceiv'd them out of danger: and then he commands the Army in one body at their cloſe order to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way apace: He gave charge unto ſuch Horſe as he had, and his ableſt Fire-locks to bring up the Rear, and to ſecure them from the enemies Horſe. The enemy providing for a preſent charge, as they expected, when they ſaw <hi>Montroſe</hi> retreating, firſt purſued eagerly, though to no purpoſe; for he making good all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as he went, eaſily repulſed them, and without loſſe of ſo much as one private Souldier, came chearfully off into the heights and ſteep places that were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible unto the enemies Horſe, and for their Foot they fear'd no aſſault from them. It is remarkable, that when <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Horſe were come up into the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the enemy knew very well they were not able to perſue any further; leſt with all that pains they ſhould ſeem to have done nothing at all, they ſent out three hundred of their ableſt and readieſt Horſe to follow after them with a great ſhout and baſe language; whom when <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſaw, he call'd for onely twenty active bodied men of the Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were uſed to hunting, and very good marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116038:58"/>
and commanded them to check their inſolence; and they firſt of all creeping hither and thither, and hiding their Guns, took their aimes ſo well, that they knockt down ſome of the forwardeſt of thoſe men; who being men of the better ſort, by their example made the reſt more wary, ſo that they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to retreat. But thoſe good huntſmen being encouraged with their good ſucceſſe, as ſoon as they ſaw their enemies diſorder'd, came into the open plain, and reſolutely charged their Horſe: who, in as much fear as Bucks or Does chaſed by the Hunters, ſet ſpurs to their Horſes and fled back to their main body as if the Devill were in them.</p>
               <p>The enemy upon their retreat choſe that place for their Rendezvouz from whence <hi>Montroſe</hi> departed <hi>Methfyns</hi> Foreſt: after they had done nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred in all that expedition, but that when they found themſelves unable to cope with men, they exerciſed their cruelry upon women: for all the wives of the Iriſh and Highlanders that they light of (who followed the Camp for the love of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans) moſt baſely and ſhameleſly they hew'd in pieces. <hi>Montroſe</hi> kept his quarters at little <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> both becauſe the place was cumberſome and unpaſſable for Horſe, and lay very conveniently for receiving ſuch aids as he dayly expected with <hi>Aboine</hi> out of the North. All which time the two ſpleena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Armies lying cloſe together, rather ſtood upon their guards than offered any affront one to the other.</p>
               <p>And now at length <hi>Aboine</hi> and Collonel <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116038:58"/>
Gordon</hi> brought up their men out of the North to <hi>Dunkel;</hi> men for their number indeed fewer than was expected, but for their ſtourneſſe and true valour farre above their number. The Horſe they brought were only two hundred, and ſome ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Firelocks whom they had mounted and made Dragoons: other Foot they brought none. Along with them came tht Earl of <hi>Airley</hi> and Sir <hi>David</hi> his Sonne with fourſcore Horſe, moſt of them of the noble family of the <hi>Ogilbies;</hi> amongſt whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> Son and heir of Sir <hi>John Ogilby</hi> of <hi>Innar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wharatie</hi> was moſt eminent, not only for the rare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of his perſon, and the ſplendor of his Anceſtors, but for the honour of his valiant and happy atchievements, much above what his age could promiſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> being thus well recruited, thought it not good to loſe anytime, but marched ſtraight towards the enemy. But as ſoon as he came to <hi>Amonde,</hi> he thought it beſt to ſee in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the enemy was, and to find out whether that was true which he had receiv'd a flying report of; that was, that very many of their Auxiliaries had deſerted their colours and run home. Therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Foot to take their reſt, a little before night he fac'd the enemy with his Horſe; with which ſight being ſomething affrighted, they kept within their trenches. And next morning early <hi>Montroſe</hi> riding about to diſcover, was informed that they had ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away at the dead of the night to <hi>Methfyn,</hi> and in diſorder had got over a Bridge upon the <hi>Erne.</hi> He inſtantly cauſes his men to march, and paſſing the

                  <hi>FIfe</hi> is the moſt populous, the moſt rich, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Country Towns and Villages in all <hi>Scotland.</hi> Its Inhabitants are little martial, conſiſting moſt of Merchants, Shopkeepers, Mariners, and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But ſo new-fangled in their Religion, and ſo bewitched both by the example and authority of the Nobility, and by the Sermons of their ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters, that all of them upon the matter were extremely addicted to the Covenanters. The Country it ſelf is almoſt an Iſland, being inviron'd towards the South with the Scotiſh <hi>Fyrth,</hi> on the North with the <hi>Tay,</hi> which carrieth ſhips of great burden all along; on the Eaſt with the main Sea. No entrance thither by land but on the Weſt, in the ſtraights of which both Armies lay. The whole Country was in a diſtraction, ſome (eſpecially their much admired Preachers) that thundered nothing but Excommunications, inciting and compelling all of every eſtate and age to take up armes; others flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great numbers unto them, others running hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither to hide themſelves, as every one was led by his own ſuperſtition, confidence, or fear. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was very deſirous to aſſault the enemy, and try the fortune of a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ttel with them before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd their Forces with addition of the <hi>Fife-</hi>men; but it would not be. For they had ſo fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116038:59"/>
by the advantage of the ground, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the paſſages, that he could by no means either make his way unto them, or draw them out into plainer ground. Having therefore made them ſeveral fruitleſſe offers of battell, he reſolved to march into the heart of the Country, and came to <hi>Kinroſſe,</hi> as well to hinder the riſing of that Country, as to train the enemy at laſt out of their faſtneſs to come in unto the aid of their diſtreſſed friends. They not ſo much as daring to fall upon his Rear, turn'd another way, and keeping cloſe to the bank, firſt of the <hi>Erne,</hi> afterwards of the <hi>Tay,</hi> made ſpeed towards the Eaſt-ſide of the Country. As <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſed along, he ſent Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> before him with a ſmall party. Theſe ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of their party up and down to ſcout, kept only ten men in their company; on a ſudden they happened upon two hundred of the enemy, who were raiſing men in thoſe parts, and being not able to retreat, they twelve encountred the two hundred, put them to flight, kill'd ſome, and took other ſome priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> that night came to <hi>Kinroſſe,</hi> not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but they of <hi>Fife,</hi> who were exceedingly out of love with the King, moſt firm to the Covenanters, and wholly given to the new ſuperſtition, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally up in armes. Therefore thinking it not ſafe raſhly to engage with ſo great a multitude of Horſe and Foot, he determin'd to paſſe over the <hi>Forth;</hi> and that upon this ground, that he having wearied out the <hi>Fife-men</hi> (whom he believ'd would not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116038:60"/>
perſwaded to follow the Army further than their own borders) with long marches, might vanquiſh them without a blow. For he accounted that moſt of them being born or brought up in ſhops, or ſhips, or taverns, and not acquainted with the hardſhip of Souldiers, would preſently give out and be weary. Beſides, ſuch of the Nobility as were in rebellion (after they ſaw with ſorrow that the ſeat of the War was drawn ſo near them as the <hi>Forth)</hi> were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men with more eagerneſs than ever before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Borders, and in the Weſt; of whom the chief were the Earls of <hi>Lanerick, Caſſils,</hi> and <hi>Eglington.</hi> Whoſe levies <hi>Montroſe</hi> laboured either to hinder, or draw themſelves to his ſide before they came up to <hi>Baily</hi> and the <hi>Fife-men;</hi> therefore he marched from <hi>Kinroſſe</hi> towards <hi>Sterling,</hi> and lay that night ſome three miles from the City. The next day ſending the Foot before, he followed ſoftly after with the Horſe, becauſe he ſuſpected that the enemy purſued him in the Rear.</p>
               <p>Nor was he deceived in that ſuſpition, for ſome Eſpyals whom he left behind him, brought word that <hi>Baily</hi> was hard by with the greateſt Army that ever he had. And immediately the enemies Scouts came within view, one of whom, having been too forward, was brought priſoner to <hi>Montroſe</hi> by ſome of his Horſe. He being examined, told them free and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, that he believed <hi>Baily</hi> and his party were reſolved to march all that night to engage him to fight as ſoon as was poſſible, before they diſmiſt the <hi>Fife-men,</hi> who being already tir'd, he hardly believ'd
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116038:60"/>
would be drawn over the <hi>Forth;</hi> accounting their, work at an end as ſoon as the enemy was gone out of their own Country. Therefore <hi>Montroſe,</hi> that he might get ſpeedily over the <hi>Forth,</hi> bids his men march apace, and going on the other ſide of <hi>Sterling</hi> (a good Town, and one of the Kings ſtrongeſt Caſtles, in which the enemy had now a great Garriſon) that ſame night paſſed over the river at a Ford about four miles above the Town. And at break of day next morning made a halt a while about ſix miles from <hi>Sterling:</hi> where he had intelligence, that the enemy the night before had not come over the <hi>Forth,</hi> but quartered three miles from <hi>Sterling</hi> on the other ſide of the river. Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> holding on his intended journey, encamped himſelf in that fatal place, the Field of <hi>Kilſythe.</hi> He bids the Souldiers to refreſh themſelves, but however to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe either to fight or march, as occaſion ſhould ſerve. The enemy the mean while by an eaſier and ſhorter cut got over the <hi>Forth</hi> at <hi>Sterling-bridge,</hi> and encamped at night ſome three miles from <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſythe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the interim, the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s brother had rais'd a thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe of the friends and clients of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> in <hi>Cluidſdale</hi> and the places adjacent, and was not at preſent above twelve miles from <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſythe.</hi> And the Earls of <hi>Caſſils, Eglington,</hi> and <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne,</hi> with others of the Covenanting Nobility, were engaging the Weſt unto the ſame impious <hi>Militia;</hi> who were ſo much the readier to take up armes, by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116038:61"/>
how much they had leſſe felt the miſeries of Warre. Which things being well conſidered, <hi>Montroſe</hi> thought it beſt to fight with thoſe Forces which <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had at preſent. For although they were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than his own, yet the danger was like to be greater of his ſide, if he ſhould be put to engage with them when <hi>Lanericks</hi> and other parties were come up. But moreover he was either obliged to take this courſe, or do nothing, and return back into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands with the blemiſh of that Honour which by ſo many victories he had atchiev'd. The enemy on the other ſide being arrogant, and confiding in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their men, believ'd that <hi>Montroſe</hi> had but made a running march the dayes before, and had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Forth</hi> more out of fear than deſign, ſo that they counted it nothing to aſſault him in that ground and entrenchment which he had choſen to his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And above all, their proud hopes were moſt carefull of this, to block up all wayes of his eſcape, and to prevent his return into the Mountains. But there are ſome that ſay, <hi>Baily</hi> himſelf thought it not beſt to give him battel, but was over-ſway'd by the authority and votes of the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſome other of the Nobility that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Army, which forc'd him much againſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to draw up his men, and order the battel as be could. However it was, early in the morning they led their men ſtraight upon <hi>Montroſe:</hi> which when he ſaw, he told the ſtanders by, that that was happened which he moſt deſired, for now he could ſupply his want of men by the advantage of the ground; and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:116038:61"/>
therefore he made haſte to poſſeſſe himſelf of the faſtneſſes before them. Moreover he commands all his men, as well Horſe as Foot, to throw off their doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and to affront the enemy all in white, being naked unto the waſte all but their ſhirts: which when they had chearfully performed, they ſtood there provided and ready to fight, reſolved certainly either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or die.</p>
               <p>In the field where they intended to fight there were ſome Cottages and Country-gardens, where <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had conveniently lodg'd ſome few men; and the firſt deſign of the enemy was to diſlodge them. But it took not; for making a fierce aſſault, and being as ſtoutly receiv'd, as ſoon as they were obſerv'd to cool ſomething of their firſt heat, thoſe that mann'd the places beat them off, drave them away, and ſlew them without reſiſtance. The Highlanders being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with this happy ſucceſs, thoſe that were next thoſe places, not expecting the word of Command, ran raſhly up the hill, which lay open to the whole ſtrength of the enemy. <hi>Montroſe,</hi> although he was ſomething troubled at the unſeaſonable boldneſſe of his men, yet thought it not good to leave them enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor was it eaſie to ſay, whether the quickneſs of his relief, or the cowardlineſs of the enemy, conduc'd more to their ſafety. <hi>Montroſe</hi> had in all four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred Foot, and five hundred Horſe; a thouſand of his Foot or more had now by their own fault ſo engaged themſelves with the enemy, that they could not come off, for the enemy encounter'd them with ſix thouſand Foot, and eight hundred Horſe. But
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116038:62"/>
the enemies Rear came up but ſlowly, and while the Van made a ſtand, expecting their advance, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had opportunity to bring timely aid to his engaged men. But at laſt they ſend out three troops of Horſe, and after them two thouſand Foot, againſt thoſe raſh and almoſt loſt men of <hi>Montroſe.</hi> Which when <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> ſaw (after others had too diſhonourably ſhifted off that ſervice) he thus beſpeaks the Earle of <hi>Airley, You ſee</hi> (my noble Loid) <hi>how yonder men of ours by their unadviſedneſs have brought themſelves into a moſt deſperate hazard, and will preſently be trampled to dirt by the enemies Horſe, except we relieve them with all ſpeed. Now all mens eyes and hearts are fixt upon your Lordſhip, they think you only worthy ſo great an honour, as to repell the enemy, and bring off our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Souldiers. Beſides, it ſeemes moſt proper for you, that the errour which hath been committed by the fool hardineſſe of youth, may be corrected by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips grave and diſcreet valour.</hi> And he undertook the ſervice (as dangerous as it was) with all his heart, and being guarded with a troop of Horſe, (in which rode <hi>John Ogilby</hi> of <hi>Baldeby,</hi> who had formerly been a Collonel in <hi>Swethland,</hi> a ſtout man, and a skilfull ſouldier) led them on ſtraight upon the enemy.

of <hi>Airley</hi> and the <hi>Ogilbies, Montroſe</hi>'s Souldiers, being enraged more and more, could no longer be kept back from raiſing a great ſhout (as if they had already got the day) and falling on upon the enemy.

Which proved unſerviceable, for the victorious purſuers had the killing of them for fourteen miles: So that of all the enemies Foot that were preſent at that battell, it is thought there did not an hundred come off. Nor did their Horſe eſcape very well, of whom ſome were killed, ſome taken, the reſt diſperſt. Their Ordnance, their Arms, their Spoils, came clearly to the Conquerours, who loſt only ſix of their ſide; whereof three were <hi>Ogilbies,</hi> valiant Gentlemen, who fighting like themſelvs, ſealed the victory with their own bloud. The rebellious ſort of the Nobility (of whom many were in the fight) ſome of them by their timous running, and ſwiftneſs of their Horſes, got to the Town and ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Sterling;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſcaping to the <hi>Scotiſh Fyrth</hi> ſhipt themſelvs in ſome veſſels that lay at anchor near the ſhoar, amongſt whom <hi>Argyle</hi> (having now this third time been fortunate to a boat) eſcaped into a ſhip; and thought himſelf ſcarce ſafe enough ſo, till weighing anchor he got into the main.

and Collonel <hi>Wallace,</hi> beſides many more, whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> after quarter given uſed courteouſly, and upon the engagement of their Honours ſet at liberry.

               <p>THere was a great alteration all the Kingdome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after this battell at <hi>Kilſythe;</hi> thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell-Nobility were all of them ſore affrighted, ſome of them fled to <hi>Baywick,</hi> ſome to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> ſome to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> others into <hi>Ireland.</hi> And ſuch as before only privately wiſht well unto the King, now did no longer fear to ſhew themſelves to expreſſe their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, to pray openly for his proſperity, and to offer their ſervice. But thoſe that before had ſided with the Covenanters began to ask forgiveneſſe, to plead they were conſtrain'd to take up Arms by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and tyranny of the Rebells, to ſubmit their perſons and eſtates to the Conquerour, humbly to beſeech his protection, and to implore his wonted cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. And Cities and Countries that were furtheſt off began to diſpatch their Commiſſioners to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in their names their Allegiance to their King, their duty and ſervice to his Vicegerent, and freely to offer him Men, Arms, Proviſion, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of War. The Nobility of the Realm and the Chiefs of Septs came in thick unto the Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116038:63"/>
welcomed him, tendred their ſervice unto him, extoll'd his high and honourable atchievements, and thank'd him for them. All whom he pardoned for what was paſt, receiv'd them with liberty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity into his protection, and encouraged them to be of good chear. <hi>Nor did he lay any greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon them, than to change that covetous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſlavery which they were manacled with by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, for the ſweet and gentle government and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a moſt gracious Prince; and by laying aſide all former grudges and fewds, hereafter more religiouſly to obſerve their duty and loyalty to the good King; and thence forward never more to have to doe with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of ſeditious men, who by endeavouring to ſatisfie their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſts, had engaged King, and Subject, one againſt the other, and upon the matter ruin'd both. For his part he never had any other intention, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their Religion, their King, their Liberty, his Peers and Countrymen, by Arms (when no other means was left) out of the tyranny of Rebells, unto their antient peace, happineſſe, and glory. Which if he ſhould effect, he would give Almighty God the authour of all good things, everlaſting praiſe; but if he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however he ſhould by theſe his honeſt endeavours acquit himſelf before God, and Gods Vicegerent his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, before all good men, and his poſterity, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the whole Kingdome ſounded nothing but <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s praiſe. Men of all ſorts every where extolling the ingenuity of his diſpoſition in which he out-went all his Equals; the gallantry of his perſon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116038:64"/>
in Warr, his patience in travells, his evenneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in dangers, his wiſdom in counſells, his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſuch as ſubmitted, his quickneſſe in diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his courteſie to ſuch as he took priſoners, in a word, his truly heroick virtue in all things, and towards all men. And this honour moſt men gave him in good earneſt, and out of a ſincere affection, but ſome in craft and diſſimulation; and as every one had wit or skill they ſet forth his <hi>Encomiums</hi> or <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks</hi> in Verſe or Proſe. Yea ſuch is the volubility of humane things, and the inconſtancy of the whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling multitude, that they were not affraid openly to curſe and rail at the ringleaders and prime men of the Covenanters Faction, ſuch as <hi>Argyle, Lindſey, Loudon,</hi> and others, (whom a while agoe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and adored for Saints) as authours of all the miſchiefs that had befaln them.</p>
               <p>All things going on thus happily, the Northern parts of the Kingdome being ſecured on his back, the way being opened unto him into the South, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Rebells every where quaſh'd, their chief lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (who in conſcience of their guilt deſpaired of mercy) driven out of the Kingdome, and no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party remaining in arms; yet in the Weſt their were ſome ſtirrs. For the Earls of <hi>Caſſils</hi> and <hi>Eglington,</hi> and ſome other promoters of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters Cauſe laboured to engage the Countries in a new Warr, and were ſaid to have rais'd in a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary way the number of four thouſand men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Montroſe</hi> the next day after the Battell of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſythe,</hi> drew his men into <hi>Cluidſdale,</hi> from whence the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116038:64"/>
Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> being ſtruck with the news of their late overthrow, disbanding thoſe men that he had rais'd, was fled. <hi>Montroſe</hi> choſe that quarter as lying moſt commodiouſly for his affairs in the South and Weſt, and marched to <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal City of that Countrey. He receiv'd the Town into his protection, and entring into it with the joyfull acclamations of the people, firſt of all he reſtrained his Souldiers from plunder, and then being ſevere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the delinquents, for the terrour of others, he put ſome of the chiefeſt incendiaries of them to death. After that, in favour of the Citizens, the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came, he departed the Town, and quartered at <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Where becauſe it was but ſix miles from the City, leſt the Citizens ſhould be prejudiced by the inſolence of the Souldiers, he gave them leave to ſtand upon their guard, and defend the City with a Garriſon of the inhabitants. Hoping with ſuch acts of clemency to engage not only the men of <hi>Glaſcow</hi> unto himſelf, but the inhabitants of other Cities alſo, by good offices more than by force and Arms.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bothwell</hi> he ſtaid many daies, where he received the perſonal addreſſes of ſome of the Nobility, and of others by their Truſtees, Friends, and Meſſengers; and ſetled the peace of Towns and Countries therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, who all willingly ſubmitted themſelvs. The chief of the inhabitants of thoſe parts who came to welcome him, and offer their ſervice were, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Douglaſſe,</hi> a man of moſt noble family and chief of the <hi>Douglaſſes,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lithgow, Anandale,</hi> and <hi>Hartfield;</hi> the Lord Barons of <hi>Seton, Drummond, Fleming, Maderty, Carnegy,</hi> and <hi>Jonſton; Hamilton</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:116038:65"/>
of <hi>Orbeſton, Charter</hi> of <hi>Hemps-field, Toures</hi> of <hi>Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leith,</hi> a moſt deſerving man (who afterwards loſt his life gallantly in battell) <hi>Stuart</hi> of <hi>Reſyth, Dalyel</hi> a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Earl of <hi>Carnwarth,</hi> Knights: and many more whoſe names I can either not rightly call to mind, or elſe think fit to forbear at preſent, leſt by giving them an unſeaſonable and thankleſſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation now whiles they lie under intolerable tyranny, I ſhould doe them more harm than honour.</p>
               <p>After the victory of <hi>Kilſythe</hi> no thoughts had higher place in <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s noble breaſt, than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of ſuch Priſoners as for no other fault but the ſin of Loyalty had been moſt baſely uſed, and ſtill expected death, in the grievous and filthy Gaol of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Therefore he ſends his Nephew <hi>Napier</hi> with Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon</hi> and a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded party of Horſe to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to ſummon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and receive it upon ſurrender, to ſet the Priſoners at liberty, and to ſettle the Town in peace and loyalty; but in caſe they ſtood out and refuſed to ſubmit, to threaten them with fire and ſword. They, as ſoon as they came within four miles of the Town, made a ſtand, (and intended to come no nearer, unleſſe they chanced to be forced unto it by the obſtinacy of the Citizens,) as well that at that diſtance they might the more eaſily reſtrain the unrulineſſe of the Souldiers, leſt they ſhould wrong the poor inhabitants, and in their fury reduce that curſed City, which had been the cauſe and fomenter of all the Rebellion, into aſhes, which <hi>Montroſe</hi> gave them eſpecially in charge by all cleans to prevent; as alſo to preſerve the Army ſafe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116038:65"/>
from the plague, which was hot in the City and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces adjacent, and whereof very many dyed every day. Aſſoon as ever the news of their approach was brought unto the Town, they all began to tremble, and deſpair of their lives; and to raiſe a cry as if the ſwords were already at their throats, or their houſes in a flame. Not a few of them being pricked in their guilty conſciences, freely and openly accus'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the moſt ungrateful, traiterous, ſacrilegious and perjured perſons in the world, and unworthy of any mercy. Then applying themſelves unto the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners they had, both calling unto them a far off, and ſending private meſſengers, they implored their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and <hi>beſought them in compaſſion of the poor ſilly people, who were almoſt waſted with a great mortality, to pacifie the anger of the Conquerours, whom they had moſt juſtly incenſed:</hi> told them, <hi>all their hopes lay in them, and they were utterly undone without their help.</hi> Proteſted moreover, <hi>that if they found mercy but that one time, they would redeem their former revolt with more religious fidelity, and conſtant Allegiance ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The Priſoners (whom but the other day the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the people bitterly abuſed and reviled, curſing and bequeathing them to the gallows and worſe) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all injuries receiv'd, and more troubled with the ſenſe than revenge of their ſufferings, firſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hearty thanks to Almighty God, who of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhewed unto them that liberty and ſafety which they little expected; and then turning unto their dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies, bade them <hi>be of good chear, for the moſt gracious King (and his Lieutenant</hi> Montroſe) <hi>deſired
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116038:66"/>
the ſafety and happineſſe of his repenting Subjects, and not their extirpation and ruine. Therefore they adviſed them immediately to ſend ſome Delegates to</hi> Montroſe, <hi>humbly to beg his pardon; for nothing could better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the rage of a Conquerour than a ſpeedy ſubmiſſion. For their parts they would not be backward to mediate with him for their ſafety, and doubted not but his high and noble ſpirit, which could not be vanquiſhed with their arms, would yet ſuffer it ſelf to be overcome with the prayers and lamentations of men in miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Edinburgians</hi> being comforted with theſe hopes, and aſſiſted with this good advice, immediately call a Hall to conſult of ſending Delegates. There were among the priſoners of thoſe that were moſt high in birth, and favour with <hi>Montroſe, Lodowick</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> Chief of the moſt antient and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble family of the <hi>Lindſeys,</hi> a man famous for Military ſervice in forein Nations, amongſt the <hi>Swedes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This man by the power and cunning of his coſen the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> (who becauſe he was greedy of the honour and title of the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> was greedy alſo of his life) was deſigned by the Covenanters to be put to death. Nor was it for any other crime but for being a Souldier, and an expert man, and one that had done faithful ſervice for his Maſter the King, and it was feared he would do ſo again if he ſhould be ſuffered to live. There was alſo <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> one ſingularly beloved by <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who was formidable both for his Fathers and his own virtue and authority. He alſo being an enemy to <hi>Argyle,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:116038:66"/>
both upon old fewds and ſome freſher wrongs, was juſt as deep in ſin and danger as <hi>Crawford.</hi> Theſe therefore the Common Councill of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> choſe out of the reſt of the priſoners, and immediately ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them at liberty, they earneſtly pray and beſeech them to aſſiſt their Delegates to the uttermoſt of the power they had with the Lord Governour, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hold his hands off that miſerable City, upon which the hand of God himſelf lay ſo heavy already. And they curſe themſelvs and their poſterity to the pit of Hell, if they ſhould ever prove unmindful of ſo great a favour, or unthankful to them that did it. They were not backward to undertake a buſineſſe which was ſo univerſally deſired, but taking the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates along with them went forth to <hi>Napier.</hi> He having by the way delivered his dear Father, his Wife, his Brother-in-law Sir <hi>Sterling Keer,</hi> and his Siſters out of the priſon at <hi>Limnuch,</hi> whither the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had removed them from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle, marched back unto his Uncle with his Forces, and thoſe priſoners now at liberty, and the Delegates of the City, as having done his buſineſſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> embracing <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Ogilby,</hi> his deareſt friend, whom he had long longed for, and rejoycing to ſee them ſafe and ſound, uſed them with all honour and accommodation after their long reſtraint, and they on the other ſide magnified their deliverer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger with high praiſes and thanks, (as became them to do,) on both ſides affording a ſpectacle of great joy to the beholders.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Delegates of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116038:67"/>
to audience, and delivered their Meſſage from the Provoſt and City. The ſum was, <hi>They would freely ſurrender the Town unto the Governour, humbly deſired his pardon, promiſed to be more dutiful and loyal for the time to come; committed themſelves and all that they had to his patronage and protection, for which they earneſtly beſought him. Moreover they undertook forthwith to ſet the reſt of the priſoners at liberty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his appointment, and to do any thing elſe that he ſhould enjoyn them. And although the City was ſo waſted with a grievous contagion that no men could be raiſed of it, yet they were ready as far as their ſhare came, to pay contribution to ſuch as ſhould be raiſed in other places. And above all things they humbly begged at his hands, that he would labour to mitigate the anger of their moſt gracious Lord the King, that he might not be too ſevere with that City, which by the cunning, authority, and example of a ſeditious and prevailing party had been engaged in Rebellion.</hi> Montroſe bade them <hi>be confident of the reſt, and required no more at their hands, than to be hereafter more obſervant of their loyalty to the King, and faithfully to renounce all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the Rebells in arms againſt him, either without or within the Kingdome; To reſtore the Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>(which it was evident was in their cuſtody at that time) unto the King and his Officers. Laſtly, aſſoon as the Delegates came home, to ſet the Priſoners at liberty, and ſend them to him.</hi> And truly as for the Priſoners they ſent them away upon their return: but as to other Articles they were perfidious, and perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and if they do not repent, muſt one day give an
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116038:67"/>
account unto God the aſſertor of truth and juſtice, for their high ingratitude, and reiterated diſloyalty.</p>
               <p>Whiles theſe things paſſed concerning <hi>Edinburgh, Montroſe</hi> ſent away <hi>Alexander Mac-donald</hi> (to whom he joyned <hi>Iohn Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ball,</hi> a ſtout Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) into the Weſtern coaſts to allay the tumults there, and to ſpoil the deſigns of <hi>Caſſils</hi> and <hi>Eglington.</hi> But they receiving the alarm of <hi>Mac-donalds</hi> approach, were immediately diſperſt in a great fright. Some of the Earls and other Nobles made ſtraight into <hi>Ireland,</hi> others plaid leaſt in ſight, in I know not what lurking places. All the Weſtern Countries, the Towns of <hi>Aire, Irwin</hi> and others ſtrove which ſhould firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, freely offering their fidelity and ſervice. Neither (which was more than he expected) did <hi>Montroſe</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find men better affected to the King than in thoſe Weſtern parts: For moſt of the Gentry, Knights, and Chiefs of Families, and ſome alſo of the prime Nobility, came off chearfully to his ſide. VVhoſe names, which otherwiſe ought to have been regiſtred with honour, at the preſent I ſhall paſſe by (if not in an acceptable perhaps, yet certainly in an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ſilence,) for I ſhould be loath ſo honeſt and loyal ſouls ſhould be queſtioned by their cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for their good affections, upon my information.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> had now taken into his thoughts the ſetling of the South-borders, and ſent unto the Earls of <hi>Hume, Rosburough,</hi> and <hi>Trequair</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116038:68"/>
them to aſſociate with him for matter of Peace and VVar, and all things that were to be done in the name and by the authority of the King. Theſe wete not only the powerfulleſt men in thoſe parts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the multitude of their friends, and their great retinue, but alſo made as though they were moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial aſſertors of the Kings authority. For beſides the bond of Allegiance, which was common to them with others, they were engaged unto him by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary benefits. Not were they only advanced unto great Honours by him, as being raiſed from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood, to a high pitch of Nobility, but were made Governours of the moſt gainful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and by that means being inriched above their equals and their own condition, heaped up wealth indeed unto themſelves, but envy and hatred upon the King. They again diſpatch ſome of their friends of the beſt quality, to aſſure him, <hi>That they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to undergo any hazard under his conduct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the behalf of their moſt bountifull King, They promiſe moreover to raiſe a world of men, and nothing hindered their comming up unto the Camp, if he would but be pleaſed to draw that way with never ſo ſmall a party of his forces. And ſo it would come to paſſe, that not only their friends and clients, but the whole Country being animated with his preſence and authority, would cheerfully take up armes as one man; and if they ſtood out, they might be compelled, or a courſe taken with them. Therefore they earneſtly beſought him to afford them his aſſiſtance in this, and in all the reſt he ſhould find them his moſt faithfull and ready ſervants.</hi> Theſe were fair
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116038:68"/>
words, and at firſt hearing, ſeemed to carry an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meaning along with them; but were promiſed with that kind of faith that the Creatures and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the too indulgent King are uſed to keep. And perhaps upon that ſcore the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> (Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Brother) is more to be commended, whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> having earneſtly ſollicited by friends to come off to the Kings ſide, although that way he might very likely expect his pardon for what was paſt, and the releaſement of his Brother, yet without any diſſimulation he gave this peremptory anſwer, <hi>That he would have nothing to do with that ſide, and that he would never pretend that friendſhip which he intended not to preſerve.</hi> And I would to God all they on whom the good King has too much relied, had delivered themſelves with the ſame candor and plain dealing ever ſince the beginning of theſe troubles.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſent the Marqueſſe of <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> over into <hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Niddiſdale,</hi> that there with the aſſiſtance of the Earls of <hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Hartfield,</hi> they might liſt as many Souldiers, Horſe eſpecially, as they could. And gives them orders withall to march with ſuch as they ſhould ſo raiſe, towards <hi>Trequaire, Roxbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> and <hi>Hume;</hi> that they might engage them without any further put-offs in an aſſociation with them: For <hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood a little what Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy-water meant, and therefore was ſomething ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious of the delayes which they fram'd, the rather, having had ſome experience of their cunning and ſlipperyneſſe, eſpecially of <hi>Trequaires.</hi> And truly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116038:69"/>
                  <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> by the chearful endeavours of the Earls of <hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Hartfield,</hi> had quickly raiſed a conſiderable party, if one count them by the head; but they were new men, taken from their plows and flocks, and but raw Souldiers: forward enough at the firſt charge, but by and by their hearts fail them, and they can by no means be kept to their colours. When <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the reſt of the Commanders conſidered this, they write again and again to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> that he would make haſte after them with his old Souldiers towards <hi>Tweed;</hi> for by his preſence and authority, and the company and example of the old Souldiers, they might be brought either willingly, or whether they would or no, to know their duties. In the mean time according to his command they goe on to <hi>Strathgale,</hi> freely offering an opportunity, and their ſervice if it needed to <hi>Roxborough</hi> and <hi>Trequair,</hi> to draw out their men more eaſily and timely. But they (good men) who well enough underſtood the ſecreteſt counſels of the Covenanters, and knew that all their Horſe would be there immediately out of <hi>England</hi> under the command of <hi>David Leſley,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended nothing more than to over-reach the King with their old tricks, and to deliver <hi>Montroſe</hi> (whoſe glory they envied) into the hands of his enemies, though not by arms (for that they could not) yet by treachery. To that end they inſinuate again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not only unto <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and his party, but to <hi>Montroſe</hi> himſelf by their friends and frequent meſſengers, that for their parts they were ready to expoſe their perſons to the utmoſt hazard, but they

could never be able to draw together their friends, clients, and Trained bands, except they were anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and encouraged with <hi>Montroſe</hi> his preſence. And that they might be the better believed, they curſe themſelves to the pit of Hell if they did not ſtand ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unalterably to their promiſe. <hi>Montroſe</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was not taken with all this, but ſtaid ſtill at <hi>Bothwell,</hi> conceiving, that if there were any truth or honeſty in their words, <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and his party who ſtill lay in the Countrey adjacent, would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the raſing and encouraging of their friends and dependents.</p>
               <p>At length when <hi>Montroſe</hi> had quartered a great while at <hi>Bothwell,</hi> moſt of the Highlanders being loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſpoil ran privily away from their colours and returned home. Preſently after their very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders deſired Furloghs for a little while, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the enemy had not an Army in the field within the borders of that Kingdome, and therefore their ſervice for the preſent might well be ſpared; beſides, they complained that their Houſes and Corn, in and with which their parents, wives, children, were to be ſuſtained that winter, were fired by the enemy, and no proviſion made for them, ſo that they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired to be excuſed for a few weeks, in which they might take care to ſecure their families from hunger and cold. Alſo they ſolemnly and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily engaged their words, that they would return many more than they went, and much refreſhed, within forty dayes. Theſe <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſeeing he could not hold them, as being Voluntiers, and fighting
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116038:70"/>
without pay, that he might the more engage them, thought fit to diſmiſſe them, not only with Licences but Commiſſions. And giving publick commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Souldiers, and thanks in his Majeſties name to the Commanders, exhorting them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their buſineſs cloſely and vigorouſly, he appoints <hi>Alexander Mac-donald,</hi> their Countryman and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (who was but too ambitious of that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to be their Companion and Guide, who ſhould bring them back to the Camp by the day appointed. Who in a ſet ſpeech gave thanks in all their names to the Lord Governour for his ſo noble favour, and as if he had been their Bail or Surety, with a ſolemn Oath undertook for their ſudden return: yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw <hi>Montroſe</hi> after. Nor was he contented to carry away with him the whole Forces of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, (who were more than three thouſand ſtout men) but he privily drew away ſixſcore of the beſt Iriſh, as if (forſooth) he had pick'd them out for his Life-guard.</p>
               <p>About this very time many meſſengers came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes to <hi>Bothwell</hi> from the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Amongſt whom one was <hi>Andrew Sandilands,</hi> a Scotch-man, but bred in <hi>England,</hi> and entred into holy Orders there, a very upright man, faithful to the King, and much reſpected by <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued conſtantly with him unto the end of the War. Another was Sir <hi>Robert Spotſwood,</hi> once the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Preſident of the higheſt Court in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now his Majeſties Secretary for that Kingdom, who paſſed from <hi>Oxford</hi> through <hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>Angleſey,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:116038:70"/>
and thence getting a paſſage into <hi>Loghaber,</hi> came into <hi>Athole,</hi> and was conducted by the men of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole</hi> unto <hi>Montroſe.</hi> Almoſt all the Agents that came brought this Inſtruction amongſt the reſt, <hi>That it was his Majeſties pleaſure, that he ſhould joyn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf the Earls of</hi> Roxburgh <hi>and</hi> Trequaire, <hi>and confide in their advice and endeavours; of whoſe fidelity and induſtry no queſtion was to be made.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>that he ſhould make haſte towards the</hi> Tweed, <hi>where he ſhould meet a party of Horſe which the King would inſtantly diſpatch out of</hi> England <hi>to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him, with whom he might ſafely give battel to</hi> David Leſley, <hi>if (as was ſuſpected) he marched that way with the Covenanters Horſe.</hi> All this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective bearers unanimouſly delivered, and his moſt excellent Majeſty being over-credulous ſignified by his Expreſſes. And <hi>Montroſe</hi> being now over-born with the Kings abſolute Commands, takes up his reſolution to march to the ſide of <hi>Tweed.</hi> But the day before he went, the Souldiers being drawn up to a Rendezvouz, (before that <hi>Mac-donald</hi> and the Highlanders were gone) Sir <hi>Robert ſpotſwood</hi> making an humble obeyſance under the Kings Standard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Majeſties Commiſſion under the Great Seal unto <hi>Montroſe,</hi> which he again gave unto <hi>Archibald Primroſe</hi> Clerk of the Supreme Councill to be read aloud. That being ended, in a ſhort but ſtately Oration, he commended the valour and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the Souldiers, and the great affection he bore them. And for <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> he not only extoll'd his gallantry in the head of the Army, but by vertue of,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116038:71"/>
that authority that he had received from the King, gave him the honour of Knighthood. For not only <hi>Montroſe</hi> but all the Kings friends were confident of the integrity of the man; whoſe good opinion he deceiv'd, not only to the undoing of the Kings cauſe, but the utter ruine of himſelf and his friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> following his intended journey, came the ſecond night to <hi>Calder</hi> Caſtle; at which time the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> (whether the Lord Governour would or no) carried away with him not only his own men, but all the reſt of the Northern Forces, whom he had inveighled to deſert the ſervice. Nor would he be perſwaded either by reaſon, or the intreaty of his friends (who heartily deteſted that ſhameful act) to ſtay but ſo much as one week, and then he might depart, not only with the Generals licence, but with honour, and the good eſteem of honeſt men. Seeing it would be no better, <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſing by <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> led his ſmall Army through <hi>Lothianſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Strathgale</hi> joyned with <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and the other Commanders, whoſe Forces being much diminiſhed, were dayly mouldring more and more. In that coaſt <hi>Traquaire</hi> himſelf came unto him, more chearful and merry than he uſed to be; who pretended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a moſt faithful Servant, not only to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, but alſo to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the next day ſent him his Son the Lord <hi>Linton,</hi> with a gallant party of Horſe, as if they were to be under his command, that by ſo likely a pledge he might make <hi>Montroſe</hi> more ſecure, and ſo more eaſily ruine him. For this was not the firſt time that <hi>Traquaire</hi> plaid the Covenanters
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116038:71"/>
Scout-Maſter: that ungratefulleſt piece of mankind intending to betray unto them <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and in him the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now when he was not above twelve miles from the Lords <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and they ſent not ſo much as a Meſſenger to him, nor offered him the ſmalleſt courteſie, <hi>Montroſe</hi> being much troubled at it, reſolved to march into their Territories, and to bring them in either by fair means or foul. But they prevented him by a ſingular device; They ſent unto <hi>David Leſley,</hi> whom they well knew by that time was come to <hi>Berwick</hi> with all the Scotch Horſe, and many Engliſh Voluntiers (for they were privy to all their counſels) and intreated him to ſend a party and carry them away in the condition of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; which he did the day before <hi>Montroſe</hi> came thither. For by this means that crafty old fox <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> (who had <hi>Hume</hi> under his girdle) conceiv'd that they might both ingratiate themſelves with the Covenanters, as freely committing themſelves into their Protection, and yet keep in the Kings favour, whiles they made as if they fell into <hi>Leſley</hi>'s hands ſore againſt their wills. And this being <hi>Leſley</hi>'s firſt noble exploit, he paſſed over <hi>Tweed,</hi> and marched into the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Lothian. Montroſe</hi> aſſoon as he perceived the King and himſelf betray'd by theſe men, and ſaw no hopes of that party of Horſe which was come from the King, and that the too powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy would block up his paſſage into the North and Highlands, reſolved to march with thoſe few men he had into <hi>Niddiſdale</hi> and <hi>Anandale,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116038:72"/>
of <hi>Ayre,</hi> that he might there raiſe what Horſe he could. For although he had no certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concerning the ſtrength of the enemy, yet he conjectured that it conſiſted eſpecially in Horſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> ariſing from <hi>Kelſoe</hi> marched to <hi>Jed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Selkirk;</hi> where he quartered his Horſe in a Village, and his Foot in a wood cloſe by. For he was reſolved to make ſure of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ground, leſt he ſhould be forced to fight with an enemy, of whoſe ſtrength he knew nothing, upon uneven terms. Then he commands the Captains of Horſe to ſet out good ſtore of faithful and active Scouts, and to place Horſe-guards in convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on every ſide, and look well to their watch. All which he in perſon (as he uſed to do) could not ſee done at preſent, becauſe that night he was diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters to the King, and to ſend away a truſty meſſenger that he had light upon, before break of day: therefore he was earreſt with them to have the more care, leſt the enemy, who were very ſtrong in Horſe, ſhould ſurpriſe them unawares. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders promiſing all care and diligence, he was ſo taken up with writing of Letters, that he ſlept not all that night. And ſending ever and anon to the Captains of Guards (men that were skilful Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſo known to be in Forein Countries) ſuch uncertain noiſes as were brought unto him of the enemies approach, they being deceiv'd either by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116038:72"/>
the negligence of their Scouts or their own miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, very confidently ſent him back word there was no enemy in thoſe parts, nor in the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. At the break of day ſome of the beſt Horſe, and moſt accquainted with the Country, were ſent out again to Scout; they alſo brought word they had been ten miles about, and diligently examined all by-ways, and raſhly wiſht damnation to themſelvs if they could find an enemy in arms within ten miles. But afterward it appeared when it was too late, that the enemy with all their Forces were then ſcarce four miles from <hi>Selkirk,</hi> and had lain there all that night in their arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſley</hi> that day that <hi>Montroſe</hi> departed from <hi>Jed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> muſtered his men upon <hi>Gladeſmore</hi> a plain in <hi>Lothianſhire;</hi> where holding a councill of War with the chief of the Covenanters, the reſult was, that he ſhould march to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Forth,</hi> that he might hinder <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s retreat into the North, and force him to fight, whether he would or no, before he joyned with his Highlanders. But <hi>Leſley,</hi> contrary to that reſolution, gives order on a ſudden to his whole Forces to wheel to the left hand, and to march away apace; every one wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that knew not the myſtery of the buſineſſe, what ſhould be the meaning of that change of his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his intention in that ſudden expedition, for they marched ſtraight to <hi>Strathgale.</hi> But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, (as they afterward gathered from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themſelvs) he had received letters, by which he had perfect notice, that <hi>Montroſe</hi> being attended
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116038:73"/>
only with five hundred Foot, and thoſe Iriſh, and a very weak party of new-rais'd Horſe, might very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſurpriſed on the borders of <hi>Tweed,</hi> if <hi>Leſley</hi> would make uſe of that opportunity was offered him to do his buſineſſe. Therefore <hi>Leſley</hi> upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence made haſte thither, and (as I ſaid) lodg'd within four miles of <hi>Selkirk.</hi> That <hi>Traquaire</hi> ſent thoſe letters unto <hi>Leſley,</hi> although it was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall report, I cannot certainly affirm; but it cannot be denied that that ſame night he ſent his Commands to his ſon the Lord <hi>Linton,</hi> that he ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately withdraw himſelf from the Royal party, which with much jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lity he did. This was like themſelves, being the ungratefulleſt of all men, deſerting their King of whom none had better deſerved, and ſtaining their poſterity. And truly, that morning being very miſty gave no ſmall advantage to the treachery of the enemy; whom at laſt <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s frighted Scouts diſcovered to march towards him in a full body, at ſuch time as they were not above half a mile off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> mounting the firſt Horſe he could light on, gallops into the field appointed for the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz that morning; where he finds a great deal of noiſe, but no order. The Cavalry being little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their duty, and lying already diſperſt in their quarters, where they dream'd more of bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their horſes than maintaining their lives and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, upon the firſt alarm which they received from the enemies Trumpet, ran diſorderly up and down they knew not whither, but never came in the fight. Yet there were a few, and thoſe were for the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116038:73"/>
moſt part Noble men or Knights, who made all ſpeed thither, and gallantly undertook to make good the right wing: and they were not above ſix ſcored <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n all. Nor did the Foot (who were about five hundred) make a good appearance, for many of them looking about their private buſineſſes among the Carriages, by that unſeaſonable care of ſaving; loſt themſelves and all they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, which ſpoiled the matter which was bad enough before, moſt of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were abſent, and never came in the field. Beſides, the enemy comming on ſpeedily left them no time for deliberation. The enemy therefore who were ſix thouſand (whereof moſt were Horſe out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> furiouſly charging <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s right wing were twice gallantly received and repulſed with no ſmall loſſe; Nor could they make that noble Troop give any ground, or break thorow it, untill at laſt laying along thoſe few foot that withſtood them they broke in upon the left flank where ther was no horſe. By this, two thouſand Horſe whom the enemy had ſent over to the other ſide of the river, were gotten on the Rear of thoſe noble Gentlemen, who, leſt being hemm'd in on every ſide, and gall'd with the enemies ſhot at diſtance, they ſhould fall for nothing, and unreveng'd, withdrew themſelves every one the beſt way he could. But the Foot, who could have little ſecurity by flight, fighting a good while ſtoutly and reſolutely, at laſt upon quarter ask'd and given for their lives, threw down their arms, and yeelded themſelvs priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Every one of whom being naked and unarm'd without any regard to quarter given, <hi>Leſley</hi> cauſed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116038:74"/>
to be moſt unhumanely butcher'd. The ſtain of which perfidious cruelty (by which he hath ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily blurr'd his honour, if eany he got in forein ſervice) he ſhall never be abl to wipe away. As for thoſe that eſcaped out of the battell, the enemy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them no further, being buſie in plundring the Carriages, where they made a lamentable ſlaughter of Women, Pedees, and Cook-boys: no pitty was ſhown to ſex nor age, they went to the pot all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The number of the ſlain is not eaſie to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, almoſt no Horſe, and very few Foot (beſides thoſe that yeelded themſelvs and had quarter) fell in that battell: which may appear by this, that they were no more then five hundred in all, and before the next day two hundred and fifty of them came ſafe to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> all of them with their ſwords by their ſides, ſo that there could not be as many more miſſing: and very few were taken priſoners, and not until their horſes being tired, and themſelvs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the way, they became a prey to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people. Whom they, forgetting all the benefits and protection they had but newly received from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> to do the Covenanters a favour, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto their cruell enemies, to be made by them acceptable ſacrifices to <hi>Baal-Berith,</hi> the god of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For all that, the Rebell conquerours miſſed of the Kings Standards. The one of them (which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Foot) was preſerved by an Iriſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a ſtout man, and of a preſent ſpirit, when others were almoſt beſide themſelves; who when he ſaw
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116038:74"/>
that the enemy had got the day, ſtript it off the ſtaff, and wrapped it about his body: and being oherwiſe naked, made his way with his drawn ſword through the thickeſt of the enemy, and brought it to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> at night. Whom he received into his Lifeguard, and gave it him to carry in token of his valour and loyalty. And the other of them <hi>William Hie</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Earl of <hi>Kinoule,</hi> a hopefull young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (who ſucceeded his Uncle by the mothers ſide, <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who having receiv'd many and grievous wounds at the battell of <hi>Alford,</hi> was rendred unable for that burden) ſtript from off the ſtaff too, and carried it away with him. And conveighing himſelf into the borders of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> skulked there a while, till the coaſt was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle clearer about <hi>Tweed,</hi> and then through by-ways and night-journeys for the moſt part (being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied and conducted by his faithfull friend <hi>Robert Toures,</hi> a ſtout man and a good ſouldier, who had been a Captain in <hi>France</hi> a good while agoe) retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the North, and preſented that ſame Royal Standard unto the General.</p>
               <p>And now at laſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> when he ſaw his men totally routed and put to flight (which he never ſaw before) thought of nothing more for a good ſpace than to die honourably, and not unrevenged; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rallying about thirty Horſe whom he had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in that confuſion, he reſolved by fair and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable death to prevent his falling alive into the enemies hands. And ſeeing he was not able to break thorow the enemies Troops (who ſtood thick round
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116038:75"/>
about him) he gall'd them on the Front, and Rear, and Flanks, and of ſuch as were ſo hardy as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture out of their ranks, many he ſlew, others he beat back. But when all that he could do would not do his buſineſſe, as God would have it, this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration poſſeſſed his reſolute and noble ſpirit; That <hi>the loſſe of that day was but ſmall and eaſily regained, becauſe but an inconſiderable part of his Forces were there. That the Highlanders were the very Nerves and ſinewes of the Kingdome, and all the North was ſound and untouch'd. That many of the prime Nobility and men of power, many Knights too and Chiefs of their Septs had entred into an aſſociation with him; who if he ſhould miſcarry would be ſuddenly ruined or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and by that means the Kings party in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>utterly ſubdued. Therefore he thought himſelf bound never to deſpair of a good cauſe, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt the King his Maſter ſhould apprehend the loſſe of him to be greater than the loſſe of the battell.</hi> And while theſe thoughts were in his head, by good hap came in the Marqueſſe <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Dal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell,</hi> with ſome other friends (not many but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gallant men) who with tears in their eyes (out of the abundance of their affection) beſeech, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, implore him <hi>for the honour of his former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, for his friends ſakes, for his Anceſtors, for his ſweet wife and childrens ſakes, nay for his Kings, his Countries, and the Churches peace and ſafeties ſake, that he would look to the preſervation of his perſon; conſidering that all their hopes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on him alone under God, and that their lives were
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116038:75"/>
ſo bound up with his, that they muſt all live or die together.</hi> At laſt <hi>Montroſe</hi> overcome with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, charging thorow the enemy (who were by this time more taken up with ranſacking the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages than following the chaſe) made his eſcape; of thoſe that were ſo hardy to purſue him, ſome he ſlew, others (among whom was one <hi>Bruce</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Horſe, and two Cornets with their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards) he carried away priſoners. Whom he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained curteouſly, and after a few dayes diſmiſt them upon their <hi>Parole,</hi> that they ſhould exchange as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Officers of his of the like quality, which <hi>Parole</hi> they did not over-punctually perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> was gotten ſcarce three miles from <hi>Selkirk</hi> when he having overtaken a great number of his own men that went that way, he made a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiderable party, ſo that being now ſecure from being fallen upon by the Country people, he march'd away by leiſure. And as he went by the Earl of <hi>Traquaires</hi> Caſtle (by whoſe diſhoneſty he did not yet know that he had been betray'd) he ſent one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to call forth him and his Son, that he might ſpeak with them, but his ſervants bring word that they were both from home. Notwithſtanding there are Gentlemen of credit that teſtifie, that they were both within; nor did that gallant Courtier only bid the Rebells joy of their victory, but was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to tell abroad (not without profuſe and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming laughter) that <hi>Montroſe</hi> and the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Scotland</hi> were at laſt totally routed; his own daughter the Counteſſe of <hi>Queensbrig,</hi> as far as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116038:76"/>
modeſtly ſhe might, blaming him for it. <hi>Montroſe</hi> after he had made a holt a while near a Town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Plebis,</hi> untill the ſouldiers had refreſh'd themſelvs and were fit to march, many flocking to them from every ſide, at Sun ſet they all ſtoutly entered the Town; and by break of day next morning (by the conduct of Sir <hi>Iohn Dalyel</hi> eſpecially) paſſed over <hi>Cluid</hi> at a ford. Where the Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> having eſcaped another way met with him, making nothing of the loſſe of the battell aſſoon as they ſaw him out of danger. Nor was he leſſe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the ſafety of his friends, than that he had ſav'd and pick'd up by the way almoſt two hundred Horſe. But although he was already ſecure enough from the purſute of the enemy, nevertheleſſe he reſolved to make what haſte he could into <hi>Athole;</hi> that taking his riſe there, he might draw what forces he could raiſe of the Highlanders, and other friends into the North. Therefore paſſing firſt over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and then the <hi>Ern,</hi> having marched through the Sherifdome of <hi>Perth</hi> by the foot of the Mountains, he came thither. As he was on his way, he had ſent before him <hi>Douglaſſe</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> with a party of Horſe into <hi>Angus,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> into <hi>Marre,</hi> that they might ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily raiſe their friends and dependents in thoſe parts; and had alſo ſent Sir <hi>Iohn Dalyel</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negy</hi> (with whom he had lately contracted affinity) with Commiſſions to that purpoſe. Moreover he ſent Letters to <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> to require him according to his promiſe to return with the Highlanders by the day appointed. But above all he ſollicited <hi>Aboine</hi>

both by Letters and ſpecial meſſengers, that he would bring back his friends and clients, who were willing enough of themſelves, and wanted no other encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement than his authority and example.</p>

               <p>IT was towards the latter end of Harveſt, nor was he corn reap'd in that cold Country, nor their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and cottages, which the enemy had butnt, repaired againſt the approaching winter (which is for the moſt part very ſharp thereabouts) which made the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole</hi> men to abate ſomething of their wonted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe. Yet <hi>Montroſe</hi> prevailed ſo far with them, that they furniſhed him with four hundred good Foot, to wait upon him into the North, where there was leſſe danger; and faithfully promiſed him upon his return, when he was to march South-ward, he ſhould command the whole power of the Country.</p>
               <p>Mean time frequent expreſſes came from <hi>Aboine,</hi> that he would wait upon him immediately with his Forces; and <hi>Mac-donald</hi> promiſed no leſſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſome other Highlanders. <hi>Areskin</hi> ſignified alſo unto him that his men were in readineſſe, and waited for nothing but either <hi>Aboines</hi> company (who was not far off) or <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s commands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time there were very hot but uncertain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a ſtrong party of Horſe that were ſent him from the King, whom many conceived not to be far from the South borders. But other news they had which was too certain, to wit, that there was a moſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:116038:77"/>
cruel butchery of what priſoners the Rebels had, without any diſtinction of ſex or age: ſome falling into the hands of the Country people, were baſely murthered by them; others who eſcap'd them (and found ſome pity in them that had ſo little) being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, were by order from the Rebel Lords thrown head-long from off a high bridge, and the men, together with their wives and ſucking children, drown'd in the River beneath; and if any chanced to ſwim towards the ſide, they were beaten off with pikes and ſtaves, and thruſt down again into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Noble-men and Knights were kept up in naſty priſons, to be expoſed to the ſcorn of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and certainly doom'd at laſt to loſe their heads. <hi>Montroſe</hi> was never ſo much troubled, as at this ſad news.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the end he might ſome way relieve his diſtreſſed friends, being impatient of all delay, with wonderfull ſpeed he climbs over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> and paſſing through the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> maketh unto the Lord of <hi>Aboine,</hi> that he might encourage him by his preſence to make more haſte into the South. For his deſign was, as ſoon as he had joyned his forces with <hi>Areskins</hi> and <hi>Airleys,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Mac-donald</hi> and other Highlanders, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the <hi>Athole-</hi>men by the way, to march in a great body ſtraight over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and ſo both to meet the Kings Horſe, and to fright the enemy, upon their apprehenſion of an imminent danger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from putting the priſoners to death. For he conceived they dnrſt not be ſo bold as to execute
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:116038:77"/>
their malice upon men of Nobility and Eminency, as long as they had an enemy in the Field, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was uncertain. And truly, they being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſolicitous what might be the ſucceſſe of ſo great warlike preparations as they knew were in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, did deferre the execution of the priſoners. <hi>Montroſe</hi> upon his journey found the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> very ſick, but his clients (whoſe fidelity and valour he had ſundry experiences of, even in the abſence of their Lord) all in a readineſſe if <hi>Aboine</hi> did but doe his part; for they depended much upon his example and authority. And now the Marqueſſe of <hi>Huntley,</hi> after he had playd leaſt in ſight for a year and ſome months, (it is hard to ſay, whether awaken'd with the news of ſo many victories obtained by <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the reducing of the Kingdome, or by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influence of ſome bad ſtarr) was returned home. An unfortunate man and unadviſed, who howſoever he would ſeeme moſt affectionate unto the Kings Cauſe (and perhaps was ſo) yet he endeavoured by a cloſe and diſhonourable envy, rather to extenuate <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s glory than out-vie it. Which ſeeing it was not for his credit openly to profeſſe even before his own men (who were ſufficient witneſſes of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s admirable vertues) leſt by that he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome ſymptomes of a heart alienated from the King: yet he gave out that for the time to come he would take upon himſelf the conduct of the Warr againſt the Rebells; therefore he commanded his Tenants, and adviſed his friends and neighbours, ſcarce without threats, to fight under no command
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116038:78"/>
but his own. And then they replyed, <hi>What ſhall we then anſwer to the Commands of the Marqueſſe of</hi> Montroſe, <hi>whom the King hath declared General Governour of the Kingdome, and General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That he himſelf would not be wanting to the Kings ſervice; but however, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned much both his and their honour, that the King and all his men ſhould know what aſſiſtance they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, which could not otherwiſe be done than by ſerving in a body by themſelves.</hi> Moreover he fell to magnifie his own power, and to undervalue <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s; to extoll unto the skies the noble Acts of his Anceſtors, (men indeed worthy of all honour) to tell them, <hi>That the</hi> Gordons <hi>power had been formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their neighbours for many ages by-gone, and was ſo yet; That it was moſt unjuſt that the atchievements gotten with their blood and proweſſe, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted upon another mans</hi> (meaning Montroſe's) <hi>ſcore: but for the future he would take a courſe, that neither the King ſhould be defrauded of the ſervice of the</hi> Gordons, <hi>nor</hi> the Gordons <hi>of their deſerved ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, favour, and reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things the ſimpler ſort took to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon all the grounds of equity and honour in the world; but as many as were underſtanding men, and knew better the diſpoſition of the perſon, ſaw through thoſe expreſſions a mind too rancorous and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indiſpos'd towards <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and that his aim was to fetch off as many as he could from him, not only to the utter ruine of the King and Kingdom, but even to his own deſtruction: which God knows)
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:116038:78"/>
the ſad event made too manifeſt. Nor were there wanting amongſt them deſperate men, and of good fore-ſight, who condemned this counſell of his as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, unſeaſonable, and pernicious even to himſelf. For they conſidered with themſelvs, that <hi>he never had any deſign that did not miſcarry either by bad play, or bad luck. That buſineſſes were better carried by</hi> Montroſe, <hi>and it was ill to make a faction upon the poor pretence of his carrying away the honour of it. For if</hi> Huntley <hi>joyned his Forces, and communicated his counſels unto</hi> Montroſe, <hi>he ſhould not be only able to defend himſelf, but ſubdue his enemies, and gain unto himſelf the everlaſting honour of being one of the Kings Champions; but if he ſhould make a breach in that manner, it would prove not only diſhonourable but deſtructive unto him. That</hi> Montroſe <hi>(it could not be denyed) had got many and eminent victories with the aſſiſtance of the</hi> Huntleys, <hi>but they had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of note without him.</hi> Therefore they earneſtly deſired him, <hi>conſtantly to adhere unto the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, which as it would be both acceptable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the King, ſo it would be well taken with good men, and honourable to himſelf.</hi> Nor did ſome of them fear to profeſſe openly, that they would yeeld their duty and ſervice to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> if <hi>Huntley</hi> ſhould ſtand out in his humour; and they were as good as their words. But he refuſing the advice of his friends, reſolved, what ever came on't, to run counter to <hi>Montroſe;</hi> nor did <hi>Montroſe</hi> ever propoſe any thing, though never ſo juſt, or honourable, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, which he would not croſſe or reject. And if
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:116038:79"/>
at any time <hi>Montroſe</hi> condeſcended to his opinion (which he did often and of purpoſe) he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn his mind; ſeeming to comply with him ſometimes before his face, but alwayes averſe unto him behind his back, and indeed ſcarce well agreeing with his own ſelf.</p>
               <p>For all this, <hi>Aboine</hi> being at that time ſolicited by many expreſſes from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his own friends (that he might be ſome way as good as his word) met him with a conſiderable party at <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>minore,</hi> a Caſtle of the Lord <hi>Forbeſes.</hi> He brought with him fifteen hundred Foot and three hundred Horſe, all cheerfulI and ready to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any hazard under the command of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe.</hi> And truly aſſoon as ever they met, <hi>Aboine</hi> freely proteſted he would carry thoſe men that he had whitherſoever the Lord Governour ſhould lead him; but there were many more behind (which for his ſcantneſſe of time he had not got together) which his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> would bring him. <hi>Montroſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling highly his fidelity and pains, turned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain almoſt the ſame way he came; that taking up the Lord <hi>Areskins,</hi> and the <hi>Marre</hi> Forces by the way, and climbing over <hi>Grainsbaine,</hi> he might fall down into <hi>Athole</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> not doubting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a fortnight to be able to paſſe over the <hi>Forth</hi> with a great Army. The firſt dayes journey <hi>Aboine</hi> and his men marched with a good will, but the next night his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> (whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> had placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the Earl of <hi>Crawford)</hi> conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf homewards with a ſtrong party of Horſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:116038:79"/>
making as if he meant to encounter ſome Troops of the enemy, and carryed along with him as many ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as he could get, upon pretence of a guard. <hi>Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> returning brought word that <hi>Lewis</hi> was gone home, but would be back again next day, for ſo he had made him believe, though he intended nothing leſſe than to come back, a Youth liable to cenſure for more feats than that. But when upon the third day they came to <hi>Alford,</hi> it was obſerved that <hi>Aboines</hi> men were ſlow to ſtand to their colours, that they loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their march, that their ranks were thin and diſordered, and that they ran away by whole compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es almoſt every night: and at laſt their Commander <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boine</hi> himſelf was not aſhamed to deſire to be excuſed, and to have leave to depart. When all men wondered, and deſired to know what might be the reaſon of that ſudden alteration of his reſolution, he pleaded <hi>his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Commands, which he was oblig'din no caſe to diſobey; and that his father had not ſent him ſuch directions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt occaſion, for the enemies Forces lay in lower</hi> Marre, <hi>and would be preſently upon their backs, if they were deprived of the protection of their own men: and that it was unexcuſable folly for him to carry his men another way, when his own Country was in ſo much danger.</hi> Montroſe reply'd, <hi>That it was moſt certain, that only a few Troops of Horſe kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>that they had no Foot at all, and thoſe few Horſe nor durſt nor could doe the Country any harm; and there was no doubt but upon the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of his approach, their Commanders would ſend for thoſe alſo to ſecure the Low-lands. Beſides,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116038:80"/>
that it would be much more to the Marqueſſe of</hi> Huntleys <hi>advantage, if the ſeat of Warr were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the enemies Country, than be kept up in his own: and upon that ſcore there was more need to make haſte into the South, that they might ſave the North from the burden of the Armies.</hi> He added moreover, <hi>That he daily expected aids out of</hi> England, <hi>which could by no means joyn with them except they met them on the South-ſide the</hi> Forth. And at laſt, with much reſentment he repreſented unto him <hi>the condition of the priſoners (who were many of them</hi> Huntley's <hi>own kindred, allies, or friends) who would all be unhumanly murthered except they timely prevented it.</hi> To all this when <hi>Aboine</hi> had nothing to anſwer he deſired his father might be acquainted with the whole matter, and 'twas granted. Such were made choice of to treat with <hi>Huntley,</hi> as were conceived to be higheſt in his favour, to wit, <hi>Donald</hi> Lord <hi>Reſe,</hi> in whoſe Country he had ſojourned, and <hi>Alexander Irwin</hi> the younger of <hi>Drumme,</hi> who had but the other day married <hi>Huntleys</hi> daughter: and both of them were alſo much obliged to <hi>Montroſe</hi> for their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered liberties. <hi>Reſe</hi> being aſhamed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the repulſe, had not the confidence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and <hi>Irwin</hi> (a Noble young Gentleman and a ſtout, who ſtuck to <hi>Montroſe</hi> to the laſt) brought no anſwer but his father-in-laws ambiguous Letters, of which no hold could be taken. Being deſired to deliver what he conceived his father-in-laws reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, he profeſſed ingenuouſly, he knew not what to make of him, he could get no certain anſwer but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116038:80"/>
doubted he was obſtinate in his fond conceit. <hi>Ahoine,</hi> firſt declaring how ſore againſt his will it was to part from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> urged how neceſſary it was for him to pleaſe his dear Father, who was ſickly too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more earneſtly deſired the Lord Governor to diſpence with him for a few dayes, till he could paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Father: and made an abſolute promiſe, that within a fortnight he would follow him with much ſtronger Forces. And when he had often and freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his honour to do as he ſaid, he extorted with much ado a Furlogh from <hi>Montroſe,</hi> ſore againſt his Stomach, to be abſent for the time aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboine</hi> being returned home, <hi>Montroſe</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched over the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Scharſchioch,</hi> and came down into <hi>Athole;</hi> and thence (having a little increaſed his Army) into the Sherifdom of <hi>Perth,</hi> where receiving an expreſs out of the North, he is put into new hopes, <hi>Aboine</hi> having ſent him word he would be with him with his men before the day appointed. At the ſame time came unto him by ſeveral wayes Captain <hi>Thomas Ogilby</hi> of <hi>Pourie</hi> the younger, and Captain <hi>Robert Nesbit,</hi> both of them ſent unto him from His Majeſty, with Commands, that if he could poſſibly, he ſhould make all ſpeed towards the Borders, to meet the Lord <hi>George Digby</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who was ſent unto him with a party of Horſe. The ſame Bearers <hi>Montroſe</hi> diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Aboine,</hi> to communicate unto them thoſe Inſtructions from the King, hoping by that means, being quickned with His Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the approach of aid, they would make
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:116038:81"/>
more haſte with their Forces, in the vain expectation of whom, he had trifled away too much time in <hi>Strath-Erne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the Lord <hi>Napier</hi> of <hi>Marchiſton</hi> departed this life in <hi>Athole,</hi> a man of a moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent life, and happy parts, a truly Noble Gentleman, and Chief of an Antient Family; one who equalled his Father and Grandfather <hi>Napiers</hi> (Philoſophers and Mathematicians famous through all the world) in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, but far exceeded them in his dexterity in civil buſineſs; a man as faithful unto, as highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles:</hi> ſometime he was Lord Treaſurer, and was deſervedly advanced into the rank of the higher Nobility; and ſince theſe times had expreſſed ſo much loyalty and love to the King, that he was a large partaker of the rewards which Rebels beſtow upon Vertue, often Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sequeſtration, and Plunder. This man <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> when he was a Boy, look'd upon as a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Father; when he was a youth, as a moſt Sage Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitor; when he was Man, as a moſt faithful Friend; and now that he died, was no otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his death, than as if it had been his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <hi>MOntroſe,</hi> when he had waited for <hi>Aboine</hi> with his forces out of the North now three weeks,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116038:81"/>
either on his march, or in <hi>Strath-Erne,</hi> and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Rebels began to grow more out rageous towards the priſoners, being impatient of further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay croſſeth over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and came into <hi>Leven;</hi> and he encamped upon the land of Sir <hi>John Buchanan</hi> the Ring-leader of the Covenanters in thoſe parts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that by that means, lying ſo near <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> he might fright the Rebels (who then kept a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Eſtates there) from the murther of the priſoners. To which end facing the City every day with his horſe, he waſted the enemies Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance: although at that time for the guard of the Eſtates and City, they had three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe in their quarters, and he not full three hundred, and twelve hundred foot. Notwithſtanding before his coming down into <hi>Leven,</hi> the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ſoon as they underſtood that <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi> agreed not, and that <hi>Aboine</hi> and his men had deſerted him in upper <hi>Marre,</hi> as a Prologue to the enſuing Tragedy, had beheaded three ſtout and gallant Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The firſt was Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> one of whom we have had often occaſion to make honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a valiant and expert man, dear unto <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> from a Child, and faithful unto him to his laſt breath. The chief of his Crimes was, That he would not pollute his hands with a moſt abominable mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For being ſent from <hi>Montroſe</hi> with an expreſs to the King after the battel of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner by the Enemy, and was condemned unto death, which he had not eſcaped, except for fear of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:116038:82"/>
death he had harkened unto <hi>Argyle</hi> (who moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily ſet a price upon <hi>Montroſes</hi> head, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great rewards, honours, and preferments to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould bring it in) and had taken upon himſelf to commit that Treaſon, which he abhorred with all his ſoul. By which ſhift having his life and liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, he returned ſtraight to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all unto him, beſeeching him to be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of himſelf, for not he only who heartily deteſted ſo high a villany) but many more, had been offered great matters, moſt of whom would uſe their beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſpatch him.</p>
               <p>The next was <hi>Alexander Ogilby,</hi> of whom we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpake before, eldeſt Son to Sir <hi>John Ogilby</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerwharite,</hi> deſcended of an antient Family, and much renowned in the Scotiſh Chronicles. He was but yet a youth (ſcarce twenty) but valiant above his age, and of a preſent and daring ſpirit. Nor can I hear, or ſo much as conjecture what they had to lay to his charge, but that new and unheard-of Treaſon, to wit, his bounden duty and loyalty to his King. But there was no help for't, but <hi>Argyle</hi> muſt needs ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that hopeful youth, if it had been for nothing but his names ſake; for he bare an implacable fewd to the <hi>Ogilbies.</hi> The third was Sir <hi>Philip Nesbit,</hi> of on antient Family alſo, and chief of it next his Father; who had done honourable ſervice in the Kings Army in <hi>England,</hi> and had the command of a Regiment there. Nor can I diſcover any reaſon they had to put him to death neither (beſides that which is uſed when they have nothing elſe to ſay, that mad charge of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:116038:82"/>
new High Treaſon) except it was, that their guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſuggeſted unto them, that that couragious and vigilant man might take occaſion ſome time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be even with them, for the horrid injuries they had done his Father and his Family. However, theſe men ſuffered a Noble death with patience and conſtancy, as became honeſt men and good Chriſtians. And unto theſe there are two brave Iriſh Gentlemen that deſerve to be joined, Colonel <hi>O-Chaen,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Laghlin,</hi> odious unto the Rebels only for this impardonable crime, that they had had many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of their courage and gallantry. Theſe Iriſh Gentlemen were murdered indeed at <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi> but many more were doom'd to the like execution at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> had not <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s unexpected approch within a few miles of the City had ſo much influence, that it repriev'd them till another time. The Lord Governor was very much perplexed with the news of theſe mens death, and it was a queſtion whether he was more vext at the cruelty of the Rebels, or the negligence, if not treachery of his friends. For beſides <hi>Huntley,</hi> whoſe Forces he had ſo long in vain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to come with his Son <hi>Aboine, Mac-donald</hi> alſo himſelf (of whom he entertained an exceeding good opinion) being often ſent unto, and invited alſo by the nearneſs of the place, although the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by himſelf was already paſt and gone, made no appearance of his approach. Six weeks had now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince <hi>Aboine</hi> had engaged himſelf for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Forces, and the Winter (than which our age never ſaw ſharper) was already deeply entred. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116038:83"/>
the aids that the King had ſent under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> were defeated: all which might eaſily have been ſalved, and the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again, if thoſe great Profeſſors of Loyalty had not plaid faſt and looſe in that good Cauſe.

Nevertheleſs, the Lord Governor thought beſt to take no notice of any of theſe things, but bear with them; and whiles he treats with the <hi>Athole-</hi>men for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> of that Country, he ſends again unto <hi>Huntley</hi> by Sir <hi>John Dalyel,</hi> as a more fit Mediator of friendſhip; Who was to inform him of <hi>the danger the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was in, and ſo of the preſent miſery that hung over his, and all faithful Subjects heads; and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:116038:83"/>
unto him, that it was no ones but his and his ſons fault, both that they had not brought in the ſupplies into</hi> Scotland <hi>which the King had ſent, and that the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who were gallant and faithful men, had been ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly butchered; and that yet there were many more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining that had near relations to</hi> Huntley <hi>himſelf, and ſome alſo of the prime Nobility, whom the Rebels would cut off after the ſame faſhion, unleſs they were now at laſt relieved.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>to pray and beſeech him that at leaſt he would grant the Kings Governor the favour of a friendly conference, promiſing he would give him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Huntley,</hi> although he anſwered <hi>Dalyel</hi> in all things according ro his wonted peeviſhneſs, yet he was moſt of all averſe to a Conference; as fearing (ſeeing he ſhould have nothing to anſwer to his Arguments and Reaſons) the Preſence, the Confidence, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſo excellent a Man. But <hi>Montroſe,</hi> as ſoon as things were ſetled in <hi>Athole,</hi> that he might leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted that might poſſibly bring him to better thoughts, reſolved, diſſembling all injuries, and obliging him by all good offices, to ſurprize him, and be friends with him whether he would or no; and to treat with him concerning all things that concerned His Majeſties ſervice. Therefore in the month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> he forced his way very hardly thorow Rivers and Brooks that were frozen indeed, but not ſo hard as to bear mens weight, over the tops of Hills and craggy Rocks, in a deep Snow: and paſſing through <hi>Angus,</hi> and over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> drew his Forces into the North; and almoſt before he was, diſcovered march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116038:84"/>
with a few men into <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> where <hi>Huntley</hi> then lived: But he being ſtruck with his unexpected approach, upon the firſt news he heard of him, leſt he ſhould be forced to a Conference againſt his will, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fled to <hi>Bogie,</hi> a Caſtle of his, ſituate upon the mouth of the <hi>Spey,</hi> as if he intended to ferry over the River, and to wage warre againſt the Rebels in <hi>Murray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it comes into my mind briefly to enquire what might be the reaſon why <hi>Huntley</hi> bore ſuch a ſpleen againſt <hi>Montroſe,</hi> who had never given him any diſtaſte, but had obliged him with curteſies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times undeſerved. Nor could I ever hear, nor ſo much as gueſſe at any other cauſe but a weak and impotent (emulation I cannot call it, but) envy of his ſurpaſſing worth and honour. For I ſhould be loath to ſay that his mind was ever alienated from the King, but only averſe unto <hi>Montroſe;</hi> with the unjuſt hatred of whom he was ſo poſſeſt, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated himſelf into many unexcuſable miſtakes; inſomuch as he deſired rather all things were loſt, than that <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould have the honour of ſaving them. And now being already puffed up with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming conceit of himſelf, he was the more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly enraged againſt him upon the remembrance of thoſe injuries and diſgraces he had heretofore thrown upon him; and that was the chief reaſon (as I take it) that he ſo often avoided the ſight of him. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what we have occaſionally delivered, both the father and the ſons had put neither few nor ſmall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts upno the Kings Vicegerent; ſome few of which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116038:84"/>
it will not be out of our way to relate.</p>
               <p>The great guns which we told you <hi>Montroſe</hi> had hid in the ground the laſt year, they digging them up without his knowledge, carried away in a kind of triumph, and diſpoſed of them in their own Caſtles, as if they had been ſpoils taken from the enemy, and would not reſtore them upon demand. But thoſe <hi>Montroſe</hi> had got in the fights at Saint <hi>Johns-town</hi> and at <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> in the former of which there was never a man preſent of that Family, and in the other <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men fought on the enemies ſide. Beſides, they ſo converted unto their own uſe the Gunpowder, and Arms, and other neceſſaries of War, which were gained from the enemy, and only depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Caſtles as in ſafe and convenient ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, that they would never make any reſtitution of the leaſt part of them when they were deſired. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Aboine</hi> upon his return home after the victory of <hi>Kilſythe,</hi> ſet at liberty the Earl of <hi>Keith</hi> Lord Marſhal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lord Viſcount <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> and other men of quality of the enemies ſide who were within his cuſtody, without acquainting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Kingdome: and his brother-in-law young <hi>Drumme</hi> (who by chance was preſent) earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaring his diſlike of it. Upon what terms he did it, it is uncertain, but this is evident, that (beſides the affront done to the Lord Governour, and the loſſe of <hi>Dunotter</hi> Caſtle, which was of great ſtrength and concernment in that War, and other Military advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they got by it) the Rebells would never have had the boldneſſe to fall ſo cruelly upon the Priſoners,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116038:85"/>
if he had but kept them in ſafe cuſtody. Yet more, by his own private authority, he exacted tributes, and Cuſtomes and Taxes, (which the Governour himſelf had never done) upon pretence indeed of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, but in truth to far other uſe, and to the grievous prejudice of the Kings Cauſe.

Nor would they permit them to <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s diſpoſall, though being Priſoners of War he had reſerved them for that only purpoſe, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing them to ſave the lives of gallant and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men. <hi>Huntley</hi> being pricked in his conſcience about all theſe things, was alwayes as afraid of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s preſence as of a Peſt-houſe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Monrroſe</hi> for all that, paſſing by injuries, and laying aſide all other matters, beſtowed his whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in promoting of the Kings ſervice. And to that end he was reſolved to intrude himſelf into his company though never ſo unwelcome, to inſinuate into his friendſhip upon any conditions, to yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in all things, and to deny nothing, ſo that he might qualifie <hi>Huntley</hi>'s imbittered ſpirit. Therefore leaving his Forces in their quarters, he poſted early in the morning with a few Horſe unto <hi>Bogie,</hi> and by his undream'd of approach prevented <hi>Huntley</hi> of any opportunity of flying or hiding himſelf. Aſſoon as they met, <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſo getting all that was paſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him in ſmooth and gentle language to aſſociate
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:116038:85"/>
with him in the War for the ſafety of the King and Kingdome: and gave him ſo full ſatisfaction in all things, that being at laſt overcome he ſeem'd to give him his hand, and promiſed, that not only all his men, but he himſelf would come in perſon in the head of them, and be with him with all poſſible ſpeed. Afterward they laid their heads together concerning the manner of managing the War, and agreed, that <hi>Huntley</hi> wafting over the <hi>Spey,</hi> ſhould make his way on the right hand by the ſea-coaſt of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and <hi>Montroſe</hi> was to go round about on the left hand through <hi>Strath-Spey,</hi> which was at that time of the year, a very tedious and difficult march; and ſo the deſign was to beſiege <hi>Innerneſſe,</hi> a Garriſon of the enemies, on both ſides: and in the mean time to draw the Earl of <hi>Seaford</hi> either by fair means or foul to their ſide. That Garriſon, however it might appear to be otherwiſe ſtrong and well fortified, yet was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill provided for victuall and other requiſites, which in that ſharp Winter and tempeſtuous Sea could hardly be had. And ſo now they ſeem'd to be agreed in all things, ſo that <hi>Aboine</hi> and his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> wiſh'd damnation to themſelves if they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue conſtant in their fidelity and ſervice to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> to their utmoſt breath. And the reſt of the <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> the Marqueſſes friends, were ſurpriſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible joy, and made as much of their Lord and Chief, as if he had been returned from the dead.</p>

                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Huntley</hi>'s ſpirit at laſt pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeriouſly inclined to joyn with him in the proſecution of the Warre, marched with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces through <hi>Strath-Spey</hi> towards <hi>Innerneſſe.</hi> And the more to amuſe the enemy on every ſide, he ſent his cozen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> (of whoſe worth I have had often occaſion to ſpeak) and <hi>John Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ball</hi> the younger (a gentleman of approved truſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, who had often done excellent ſervice) with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commiſſions unto the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, that if any ſhould offer to ſtirre in thoſe parts, they ſhould neglect no opportunity to ſuppreſſe them. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thole-</hi>men being encouraged by their authority and example, ſhewed themſelves very ready and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: And they wanted not long an occaſion to ſhew it, for the remainder of the <hi>Argylian</hi> party (either by reaſon of a general ſcarcity of all things in their own Country, or being driven out of their Country for fear of <hi>Mac-donald,</hi> who was very ſtrong, and threatned their ruine) fell upon the <hi>Mac-gregories</hi> and <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabies</hi> who ſided with <hi>Montroſe.</hi> And afterward joyning unto themſelves the <hi>Stuarts</hi> which inhabit <hi>Balwidder,</hi> and the <hi>Meniſes,</hi> and other Highlanders who ſtill followed <hi>Argyles</hi> fortune, were reported to make up ſome fifteen hundred men; and were ready to invade <hi>At hole</hi> unleſſe timely oppoſed. And truly they had already fired an Iland in <hi>Logh-Torchet</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had taken it by force and pillaged it, and had
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116038:86"/>
beſieged <hi>Ample</hi> Caſtle which lyeth on the ſide of the river of that name. Which aſſoon as they had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of, the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, being only ſeven hundred in all, under the Command of the aforeſaid <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Drummond,</hi> thought beſt to oppoſe them before they brake in into their Country. They upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of the advance of the <hi>Athole-</hi>men raiſed the ſiege of <hi>Ample,</hi> and retreated toward <hi>Taich.</hi> The <hi>Athole-</hi>men purſued them hotly, and find them in battell-arry not far from <hi>Kalandar</hi> a Caſtle of <hi>Taich,</hi> For they had poſſeſſed a ford, and manned the bank on the other ſide (which was fortified with a ſteep hill) with a number of Muſquetiers. Which when the <hi>Athole-</hi>men ſaw, and perceived that their Forces were not ſo ſtrong as was reported (for they had not aboue twelve hundred men) although they themſelves were ſcarce ſeven hundred ſtrong, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heartned by the gallantry and encouragement of their Commanders, they were reſolved not to ſtay to receive the enemies charge, but to charge them. Therefore they place a hundred good ſouldiers over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, as it were to make good the Ford on the other ſide, and the reſt marched away unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ford near the Caſtle, that they might get over the river there. The <hi>Argylians,</hi> when they perceived the <hi>Athole</hi> men ſo reſolute, retreat ſtraight towards <hi>Sterling.</hi> Then firſt of all thoſe <hi>Athole-</hi>men that were left below at the Ford, poſſeſſe themſelves of the bank which the enemy had quit, after that they fall upon the Rear of the retreaters, cut off ſome, ſcatter others, drive others forward; and the reſt of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:116038:87"/>
the <hi>Athole-</hi>men following hard after, put them all to flight. Fourſcore of them were ſlain, the reſt eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by flight: who fared the better, becauſe that ſame morning the <hi>Athole-</hi>men had had a foul and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous march of ten miles long, and had no Horſe at all to help themſelves. So they having come off with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit returned home.</p>
               <p>At that time the Rebells held their Convention of Eſtates at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> which they polluted with the Innocent, and I fear crying blood of men, never ſufficiently to be commended. They had amongſt their priſoners ſome very eminent men, as appeared by the hatred the Rebells bare them, (for they ſcarce ſought the blood of any but the beſt of men, but for others of whom they were not ſo much affraid, they ſatisfied themſelves only with their Sequeſtration and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) amonſt whom were the Lord <hi>Ogilby,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Spotſwood, William Murray</hi> a noble young Gentleman, and <hi>Andrew Guthery</hi> a ſtout Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and active, whom they determined to put to death in that City, to appeaſe the Ghoſts of the men of that Province with their blood, of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported above five thouſand had been ſlain in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall battells. Now, becauſe they intended not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them by Law, but according to their own luſts, they have recourſe to their old ſhifts, and make Religion draw the curtain over their cruelty. To which purpoſe they ſet up their Prophets <hi>Kant</hi> and <hi>Blair,</hi> and others that were poſſeſſed with the ſame ſpirit, who roar'd out their Pulpits bloody O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>es before the people; <hi>That God required the blood
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:116038:87"/>
of thoſe men, nor could the ſins of the Nation be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expiated, or the revenge of heaven diverted.</hi> And by this art eſpecially they provoked the hearts of the people (otherwiſe inclined to pitty) to think upon them as accurſed things, and own'd and devoted to deſtruction; perſwading them, that they ought to have no protection of humane Laws, nor any Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to plead for them, whom God himſelf indited and accus'd. Nor did thoſe excellent interpreters and deciders of Gods ſecret will, make any ſcruple to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the ſouls, and bodies, and all of ſo great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents unto hell and damnation. And having by this means blinded the people, it was eaſie for them who were their acuſers and judges both, to condemn the innocent men who were deſtitute of all Patronage and protection.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ogilby,</hi> who was not only the moſt eminent of them for Nobility and power, but alſo was a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> by his mothers ſide, and cozen-german to <hi>Lindſey,</hi> pretending himſelf ſick, with much adoe got ſo much favour as to have his mother, wife, and ſiſters ſuffered to viſit him in priſon. Which when he had obtain'd, whilſt the Keepers in reverence to the honourable Ladies, withdrew out of his chamber, he immediately puts on his ſiſters gown which ſhe had put off, and was dreſſed in all her attire. She alſo put on his cap in which he uſed to lie ſick in bed, and lay down inſtead of her brother. At laſt many ſalutations and ſome tears paſſing on both ſides, at eight of the clock in the night, in the habit and likeneſſe of his ſiſter he deceived his Keepers, who lighted him out
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:116038:88"/>
with candles and torches. And immediately depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the City, he took horſe (which he had laid for him) with two of his followers, and before morning was got out of danger. But when the next day his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant Keepers had found out their miſtake, <hi>Argyle</hi> was ſo unable to contain his wrath and revenge, that he would needs have the noble Ladies (and the more noble for this their compaſſion and adventure) brought in queſtion for it. But he could not effect it, for by reaſon of the equity of their cauſe, they found much ſtronger friends than he could, of the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> and <hi>Lindſey;</hi> by whoſe connivence it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many that all this Comedy was acted; but in a thing that is uncertain, I ſhall determine nothing.</p>
               <p>This cleanly conveighance of <hi>Ogilby</hi> out of their hands vext the Rebels exceedingly, and made them almoſt wild, whence it happened that they made a quick diſpatch of the reſt. And the firſt that ſuffered was Colonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> a man of excellent endowments both of body and mind. Who being near unto his death, bitterly lamented with many tears, that the carriage of his youth had been much otherwiſe than it ought to have been. And when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to die, they offered him an Inſtrument to ſigne, wherein he was to teſtifie his repentance, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſctibed it without any more ado; and withall call'd God, and his Angels, and the men there preſent to witneſs, that if any thing was contained in that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which was contrary to the King, his Crown or Authority, he utterly diſavowed it. Then being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from the ſentence of Excommunication under
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:116038:88"/>
which he lay for Adultery long ſince committed, to the great grief of the beholders, he laid down his neck upon the block. A man ſubject indeed to that fault, but famous for his valour and ſouldierſhip, both in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Countries and at home.</p>
               <p>The next that was brought upon the Scaffold, yet reeking with the blood of Colonel <hi>Gordon,</hi> was a man worthy of everlaſting memory, Sir <hi>Robert Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> one rais'd by the favour of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charls</hi> unto great honours, as his ſingular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues did merit. King <hi>James</hi> made him a Knight, and a privy Counſellor: King <hi>Charls</hi> advanced him to be Lord Preſident of the Seſſion, and now but of late Principal Secretary of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This excellent man (although his very enemies had nothing to lay to his charge through all his life) they found guilty of high Treaſon; which is yet the more to be lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he never bore arms againſt them; for his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency lay in the way of peace, not knowing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to drawing of a ſword. This was therefore the only charge that they laid againſt him; That by the Kings command he brought his Letters Patents unto <hi>Montroſe,</hi> whereby he was made Vice-Roy of the Kingdom, and General of the Army. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he proved at large, that he had done nothing in that, but according to the cuſtom of their Anceſtors, and the Laws of the Land. And truly he ſeemed in his moſt elegant Defence to have given ſatisfaction to all men except his Judges (whom the Rebels had pick'd out from amongſt his moſt malicious enemies that ſought his death) ſo that queſtionleſs they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:116038:89"/>
would never have pronounc'd that doleful ſentence, if they had but the leaſt tincture of juſtice or honeſty. But to ſpeak the truth, a more powerful envy than his innocency was able to ſtruggle with, undid the good man; for the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> having been heretofore Principal Secretary of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his revolt unto the Rebels, forced the moſt gracious and bountiful King to the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> to take that Office from ſo unthankful a man, and beſtow it on another: nor was there any one found more worthy than <hi>Spotſwood</hi> to be advanced to ſo high an honour. And hence hapned that great weight of envy and revenge to be thrown upon him, which ſeeing he was not able to bear out, he was forced to fall under.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Spotſwood</hi> being about to die, abating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his wonted conſtancy and gravity, according to the cuſtom of the Country, made a Speech unto the people: But that Sacrilegious thief <hi>Blair,</hi> who ſtood by him upon the Scaffold againſt his will fearing the eloquence and undauntedneſs of ſo gallant a man, leſt the myſteries of Rebellion ſhould be diſcovered (by one of his gravity and authority) unto the people, (who uſe moſt attentively to hear, and tenaciouſly to remember the words of dying men) procured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of the City (who had been once a ſervant to <hi>Spotſwoods</hi> Father) to ſtop his mouth. Which inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and more than ordinary diſcourteſie, he took no notice of; but letting his ſpeech unto the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he wholly beſtowed himſelfe in devotions and prayers to Almighty God. Being interrupted again,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:116038:89"/>
and that very importunately, by that buſie and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome fellow <hi>Blair,</hi> and asked, <hi>Whether he would not have him and the people to pray for the ſalvation of his ſoul?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That he deſired the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the people, but for his impious Prayers, which were abominable unto God, he deſired not to trouble him.</hi> And added moreover, <hi>That of all the Plagues with which the offended Majeſty of God had ſcourged that Nation, this was much the greateſt (greater than the Sword, or Fire, or Peſtilence) that for the ſins of the people, God hath ſent a lying ſpirit into the mouth of the Prophets.</hi> With which free and undeniable ſaying, <hi>Blair</hi> finding himſelf galled, grew ſo extremely in paſſion, that he could not hold from ſcurrilous and contumelious language againſt his Father, who had been long dead, and againſt himſelf who was now a dying; approving himſelf a fine Preacher of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Patience and Longanimity the while. But all theſe things <hi>Spotſwood</hi> having his mind fixed upon higher matters, paſſed by with ſilence and unmoved. At laſt being undaunted, and ſhewing no alteration, neither in his voice nor countenance, when he laid down his neck to the fatal ſtroke, theſe were his laſt words, <hi>Merciful Jeſu, gather my ſoul unto thy Saints and Martyrs who have run before me in this race.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſeeing Martyrdom may be undergone, not only for the Confeſſion of our Faith, but for any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by which holy Men make their Faith Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there is no doubt but he hath received that Crown.</p>
               <p>And this was the end (a doleful end indeed, in

               <p>THe death of his friends rroubled <hi>Montroſe</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as it had reaſon; but yet it was not able to break or ſhake his firm and ſettled reſolution. Nor did his noble and more than ordinarily elevated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ever give greater evidences of it ſelf than now. For there were many who being enraged with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy murther of their friends, egg'd him on, being already ſufficiently diſcontented, to a preſent revenge. And whiles they too much ſavoured their grief (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was juſt) and ſeem'd to deſire nothing but what was fit, to wit, to render them like for like, they wearied out the General with their many, and troubleſome, and unſeaſonable complaints. For they muſt needs be argry, that their companions, their friends, their kindred, noble and gallant Gentlemen, well deſerving of their King, their Country, and the General himſelf, ſhould be murther'd contrary to their faith promiſed them, the cuſtome of War, the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116038:91"/>
Law of the Land, of Nations, and of Nature, and all unreveng'd: and on the other ſide, ſuch Rebells as had been taken by him to be kept rather as in their friends houſes than in priſons, to rejoyce, to triumph, to laugh at their ſorrow: And therefore they humbly deſired ſuch priſoners might be tryed as Malefactors; nor would the enemy be otherwiſe frighted from their unheard-of cruelty, nor the minds of his own men othermiſe ſatisfied and raiſed up. Whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with a curteous Speech, commended them for the love they bare their friends, and told them, <hi>That the blood of thoſe honourable and innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to be reveng'd indeed, by ſuch a way as became honeſt and valiant men, not by baſeneſſe and miſchief, as the Rebells do, but by true valour, in a ſouldier-like way. It concerned them ſo to tame, as not to imitate the wickedneſſe of their enemies. Nor, if they conſidered matters well, was it conſcience, that thoſe that were priſoners with them, and ſo could not be acceſſary unto the murther of their friends, ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for thoſe ſins of which they were innocent. The faith that they had paſſed unto them was a moſt ſacred thing, and to be kept inviolate even by enemies. Why ſhould they make themſelves guilty of that which they ſo much abhorred in their enemies? The time would come when they muſt give a ſevere account of it unto the moſt righteous God, and to his Vice-gerent the King. In the mean time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let them ſet a price upon our heads, let them hire Aſſaſſines, let them ſerd in their Inſtruments amongſt us to murther us, let them make promiſes and break them, yet they ſhall

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Huntley,</hi> who intended nothing leſſe than what he promiſed <hi>Montroſe</hi> before his face, having paſſed over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and entered into <hi>Murray,</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled away his time, and waſted his ſtrength without either honour or profit, a good way off <hi>Innerneſſe.</hi> For giving his mind too much to prey and ſpoil, after he had waſted the Country, he heard a flying report that the inhabitants had hid their gold and ſilver, and the beſt of their ſtuff, in certain turrets and obſcure Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Which whiles he aſſaults in vain, and could neither by commands nor entreaties be taken off from his reſolution, the enemy ſending in proviſion on that ſide which he had undertaken to block up, relieved <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> with all things that they wanted. Which if he had hindred, as he undertook unto <hi>Montroſe,</hi> the Garriſon would have been ſhortly forced to yeeld. And <hi>Montroſe</hi> having now received intelligence that Major General <hi>Middleton</hi> was come with ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe and eight hundred Foot as far as <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> and was like to lay waſte <hi>Huntleys</hi> and the <hi>Gordons</hi> Country, ſent Collonel <hi>William Stuart</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Huntley,</hi> to entreat him to return again unto the ſiege of <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> according to his engagement: Or if he did not approve ſo well of that, becauſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was advanced ſo near his Territories, he ſhould perſwade him to joyn his Forces with his, and to march immediately towards the enemy, whom the doubted not with an eaſie hazard to overthrow. To
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116038:92"/>
which he anſwered ſcornfully, that he would look to his own buſineſſe himſelf, nor did he need the help and aſſiſtance of <hi>Montroſe</hi> to drive the enemy out of his borders. At laſt, after ten weeks ſpent in the ſiege of a ſmall inconſiderable Caſtle, and the loſſe of all the forwardeſt of his men, he was forced with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to raife the ſiege, when he was never the nearer. And in contempt, not ſo much of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> as of the Kings Majeſty, he retreated to the <hi>Spey</hi> without the conſent or Knowledge of the Vice-roy: giving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a very bad example to all men, who began to come in thick and threefold with great eagerneſſe unto the Kings party.</p>
               <p>Amongſt whom the chiefeſt for wealth and power, and multitudes of followers and dependents, were the Earl of <hi>Seafoth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Reſe,</hi> &amp; from the furtheſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Sir <hi>James Mac-donald,</hi> Chief of a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ancient family in the Highlands; <hi>Macklen</hi> alſo and <hi>Glengar</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Mac-renalds,</hi> (and many more) who were ſome of them already in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi>'s. Army with their Forces, others had ſent for theirs. And by this means before the end of <hi>March, Montroſe</hi> might have fallen down into the Low-lands with a far greater Army than ever the Scots produc'd in the memory of man. But the unexpected revolt of ſo great a perſonage did not leſſe encourage the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells to perſevere in their courſe, than ſcandalize and diſcourage honeſt and loyal hearts. Whence it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thoſe whoſe men were already come up to the Army, began to draw off, and ſteal away privately, and others to make excuſes for their delay. All which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116038:93"/>
put together made <hi>Montroſe</hi> to caſt about another way. For he reſolved (ſeeing he could do no good with vain, light, wavering and inconſtant men by gentleneſſe and good Offices) to reduce them to his obedience by his authority, backed with the ſtrength of arms and ſevere penalties; and to that end to force all the Highlanders and North-country-men, to take up arms, by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in amongſt them with a confiding party of good ſouldiers. For he well knew that many Governours and leading men in their reſpective Countries, and Chiefs of Septs were on his ſide, unto whom this courſe would be very acceptable. Nor did he queſtion but the chief and moſt powerfull of the <hi>Gordons</hi> being weary of their Lords miſcarriage, would do him the beſt ſervice they could if need was, though it ran coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto <hi>Huntleys</hi> deſign. However he was reſolved to uſe all fair means, if that would do, before he would put them to the coſt of that laſt and ſharpeſt remedy.</p>
               <p>But becauſe <hi>Innerneſſe</hi> was the moſt conſiderable ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of all the North, and the haven there moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for entertaining forein Forces, he deſired nothing more than to reduce that: therefore he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded it with the Forces he had. For the enemies Army under the Command of <hi>Middleton</hi> was above ſourſcore miles off, and <hi>Huntley</hi> and the <hi>Gordons</hi> lay half way between them in a body. Therefore <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> dealt again with <hi>Huntley</hi> to perſwade him not to loſe his time, but (as they had agreed) to joyn with him in the ſiege of <hi>Innerneſſe;</hi> or at leaſt to hover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Spey,</hi> over which the enemy was to paſſe, and to hinder their paſſage if they advanced to raiſe the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:116038:93"/>
fiege; and if they chanced to get over to joyn their Forces together and fight them. To all which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſo diſdainfully, that the Viceroy thought it high time to deſpair of any good from him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf engaged to look better to himſelf, leſt at laſt he ſhould betray him. So that putting no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Huntley,</hi> he ſent back three Troops of Horſe to lie at the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> to obſerve the motion of the enemy: and if they came to ſend him often and certain intelligence. And they, quartering themſelvs in the moſt advantageous places for ſcouting, were carefull enough to obſerve his commands; untill <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is Gordon, Huntleys</hi> ſon, who then commanded the Caſtle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> plaid a more ſhamefull prank than any he ever did before. He aſſured thoſe Captains of Horſe whom <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſent to guard the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> that the enemy lay very far off, and intended nothing leſſe than to paſſe that river and raiſe the ſiege; &amp; therefore he perſwaded them (who took him for a moſt faithfull friend) to let alone their needleſſe guards (to which they had been appointed) &amp; to come to his Caſtle to refreſh themſelvs, and with many comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments invited them to a feaſt which he had provided for them: and they had no more wit than to truſt him, and go. He entertain'd them with a huge deal of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and beſides very dainty chear, plyed them with good ſtore of wine and ſtrong waters. And with a great deal of jollity and ceremonious curteſie, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo long till <hi>Middleton</hi> with a great Army of Horſe and Foot had got over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and had gotten footing in <hi>Murray.</hi> Which aſſoon as he had notice of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116038:94"/>
he at length diſmiſt them, and that with theſe jeering terms; <hi>Go now to your General</hi> Montroſe, <hi>who will have a ſharper bout now than he had at</hi> Selkirk. Mean time the enemy marcht ſtraight and eagerly towards <hi>Montroſe,</hi> and thoſe Horſe getting paſt them with much ado, came not much before them to <hi>Innerneſſe,</hi> inſomuch as they ſeem'd to be but the Van of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and <hi>Middletons</hi> whole Army followed within Cannon-ſhor. But, as the providence of God would have it, <hi>Montroſe</hi> had notice of their approach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and having drawn off his Forces a little way from the Town, had got them all into a body. And when he perceiv'd the enemy to be much too ſtrong for him in Horſe, avoiding the plain, he retreated with his men beyond the <hi>Neſſe.</hi> The enemy falling upon his Rear, and being handſomly repuls'd, kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs alſo cloſe. The loſſe on both ſides was very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and almoſt equal. <hi>Montroſe</hi> paſſed by <hi>Bewly</hi> into <hi>Roſſe,</hi> whither the enemy purſu'd him, that taking him in the champain ground which was diſadvantageous to him, they might compell him to fight whether he would or no. But beſides that the enemy was much ſtronger than he, the Country people being faithleſſe and rotten, and <hi>Seafoths</hi> new raiſed men running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by companies from their colours, moved him with all the ſpeed he could to ſave himſelf from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horſe. Therefore paſſing by <hi>Logh-Neſſe,</hi> and through <hi>Strath-Glaſſe,</hi> and <hi>Harrage,</hi> he advanced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bank of the <hi>Spey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> was reſolved to proceed againſt <hi>Huntley</hi> as a publick enemy, unleſſe he repented, but would try
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116038:94"/>
all fair means firſt, to ſee whether it was poſſible to bring him into a better mind. To which end, taking with him only one Troop of Horſe for his lifeguard, in all ſpeed he rid twenty miles unto him to his Caſtle at <hi>Bogy.</hi> And as he was on his way, he ſent one before to give him notice of his approach; and to tell him, that he came thither alone, and without his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to no other end than to kiſſe his hand, and to be adviſed by him concerning ſuch things as concerned the Kings ſervice, and he was the more earneſt to ſpeak with him, becauſe he had newly received Letters from the King from <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he would let him ſee. But <hi>Huntley</hi> being affrighted with the firſt news of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s approach, was ſo averſe from the preſence of ſo gallant a man, that in a trice he leapt on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and with one man along with him, ran away any way he car'd not whither; nor vouchſafed the Kings Vice-roy the favour of a conference or entertainment. Which aſſoon as <hi>Montroſe</hi> underſtood, he returned back thoſe twenty miles the ſame day, being the 27. of <hi>May;</hi> and was as carefull as he could poſſibly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this frowardneſſe and unrulineſſe of <hi>Huntleys,</hi> leſt it ſhould be a bad preſident. But all would not do, for the <hi>Gordons</hi> themſelvs, and others of <hi>Huntleys</hi> friends, being moſt of them very honeſt men, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gentlemen, told all with a great deal of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deteſtation of <hi>Huntley;</hi> that by that means they might accquit themſelvs from the aſperſion of ſo unworthy an act.</p>
               <p>Nor can one eaſily ſay how great influence that mans example had upon other Northern men: The
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116038:95"/>
Earl of <hi>Seaforth,</hi> who had been but lately, and with much adoe reconciled to the Kings ſide, was conceived to begin to falter; and ſome ſay, that being ſtill unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he had then underhand dealings for the making of his peace with the Covenanters, which truly I can hardly believe. And <hi>Alexander Mac-donald</hi> himſelf, pretending I know not what, although he had had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſerious invitations, made nothing but ſleeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe excuſes and put-offs from day to day. Which carriage of his gave occaſion of ſtrange reports of him, as if he, although he was a bitter enemy to <hi>Argyle,</hi> yet had great correſpondence with and relations unto the <hi>Hamiltons;</hi> and therefore ſtaid at home, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon the preſervation of the <hi>Mac-donalds,</hi> not medling with publique affairs. Which when <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> conſidered, he reſolved without further delay to make his progreſſe over all the North-country and Highlands with a conſiderable party, to liſt ſouldiers, to encourage the well-diſpoſed, to reduce thoſe that were refractory, by the ſeverity of the Laws and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment, and to deal with them as men uſe to do with ſick children, make them take phyſick whether they will or no. And he wanted not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtruments to promote this deſigh, who had ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly laboured with him to take that courſe.</p>
               <p>While theſe things paſſed at <hi>Innerneſſe, Huntley,</hi> leſt he ſhould be thought never to have done any thing by his own conduct without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Montroſe,</hi> beſieged and took in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> (which <hi>Middleton</hi> kept with five hundred men) but with more loſſe to <hi>Huntley</hi> himſelf than to the enemy. For
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:116038:95"/>
beſides the loſſe of many valiant ſouldiers, he gave his Highlanders leave to pillage the City. But what fault thoſe poor innocent <hi>Aberdeen-</hi>men had made either againſt the King or <hi>Huntley,</hi> let them judge, who know that almoſt all of them were eminent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for their loyalty. But for the enemy whom he took in Armes, who were both many and of very good account amongſt their own party, hee diſmiſt them freely without any conditions, and look'd fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly upon them, rather like a Petitioner than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. Nor when he had many Collonels, Knights, and others of quality (who by chance were found in <hi>Aberdeen)</hi> in his hands, did he ſo much as think of exchanging any one of his own friends for them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of whom were priſoners either in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But this was his humour, being alwayes more ready to doe good for his enemies than his friends.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="21" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOntroſe</hi> being buſie about his deſign, on the laſt of <hi>May</hi> there came unto him a Herald with Commands from the King, (who by I know not what misfortune had caſt himſelf upon the Scotch Covenanters Army at <hi>Newcaſtle)</hi> wherby he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired forthwith to lay down his arms and disband, and to depart into <hi>France,</hi> and there to wait his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties further pleaſure. He being aſtoniſhed with this unexpected meſſage, bitterly bewailed the ſad condition of the King, that had forced him to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the mercy of his moſt deadly enemies.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116038:96"/>
And doubted not but that that command which was given him for disbanding, was extorted from him by the craft, or force, or threats of the Rebels into whoſe hands he had fallen. But what ſhould he do in that caſe? If he obeyed, he muſt give over the eſtates of his friends to plunder, and their lives to death; and if he ſtood in arms againſt the Kings command, he ſhould be guilty of that crime he undertook to ſcourge in others, Rebellion. And eſpecially he was afraid leſt the Rebells ſhould put his actions upon the Kings account, and uſe him the worſe for them, ſeeing they had him in their power: of which the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a fair hint in his Letter.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Montroſe</hi> reſolved to call together all the Noblemen, and Chiefs of Septs, and Knights, and others of quality that were of his ſide; that a matter of that conſequence, which concern'd them all, might be diſcuſt by general conſent. To which end, after he had received ſo many injuries from him, he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Sir <hi>John Hurrey,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>John Innes,</hi> being men of greateſt account in his Army, and (as he conceived) moſt in <hi>Huntleys</hi> favour, unto him, to deſire him to be preſent at that ſo ſerious Conſultation, and deferr'd unto him the appointment of the time and place. And to tell him moreover, that <hi>Montroſe was willing to come to his Caſtle if he thought fit.</hi> Huntley anſwer'd, <hi>That the King had ſent him Letters alſo to the ſame effect, which he was reſolved to obey; that the Kings commands were of that nature as not to admit of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, and after them nothing was left for conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> When they replyed, that <hi>that likely was</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:116038:96"/>
                  <hi>opinion too, and that he was as ready as any other to give obedience to the Kings Commands, if they were not forced; however it concern'd them all to provide in time for the ſafety of them and theirs.</hi> And that <hi>the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and authority of what they reſolved upon would be greater, even in the opinion of the enemies themſelvs, if they made a joynt and unanimous reſolution.</hi> He made no other anſwer, than that <hi>he had reſolved for himſelf, and would have nothing to do with any body elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſe</hi> therefore ſends his anſwer to the King by Letters, wherin he was very inquiſitive of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was in amongſt the Covenanters, and whether he conceiv'd himſelf ſafe in their hands? and alſo whether his ſervice could be beneficial unto him any further? And, if he was fully determin'd to have that Army disbanded which fought for him (whiles the enemy in both Kingdomes were in a military poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and crow'd over them more and more) what courſe ſhould be taken for the ſecurity of the lives and fortunes of his moſt gallant and faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who had ſpent their blood, and all that was dear unto them, for his ſake? For it was a lamentable caſe if ſo excellnet men ſhould be left to the mercy of them that had none, not only to be undone, but to be murthered. To this he received no open anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome Articles which the meſſenger brought, which were ſigned by the Rebells, with which <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> was to be content. But he in great anger rejected thoſe conditions which the enemy had made, being ſo unconſcionable as they were; and not vouchſafing ſo much as to treat with the enemy, ſent back the bearer
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:116038:97"/>
to the King, profeſſing, that as he had not taken arms up but by the King Commiſſion, ſo he would have no condition preſcribed him to lay them down by any mortal man but the Kings himſelf. Therefore he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought the King (if he thought it fit that he ſhould disband his Army) that he would not think much to make and ſigne the conditions himſelf; to which, though they prov'd perhaps very harſh, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed abſolutely to ſubmit, but he ſcorn'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of any one elſe whoſoever they were.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger returning, at laſt brought with him Articles ſigned by the Kings hand, with Injunctions now the third time, wherein he was required to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band without further delay; and the ſame meſſenger charged him in the Kings name, under pain of high Treaſon, to give obedience forthwith to the Kings Command. And beſides his Majeſties pleaſure, there was another thing which haſtened him, which was, that thoſe that had engaged with him had moſt of them privately and by their friends laboured to make their peace with the Rebels, which was evidently known by good tokens of the Earl of <hi>Seaforth</hi> and others. As for <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Aboine</hi> they did not only profeſſe themſelvs open enemies to <hi>Montroſe,</hi> but alſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall upon him by force of arms, if he did not immediately ſubmit to the Kings authority. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi> being newly arrived out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, without either men or arms, buſied himſelf to draw away all the Highlanders, as his kindred &amp; allies, to himſelf from <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s Army, whom in ſcorn he call'd the <hi>Governour of the Low-lands,</hi> making by this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:116038:97"/>
means an unſeaſonable fraction, and a pernitious one to his friends in thoſe parts. All which <hi>Montroſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well conſidered, he was forced according to the Kings command to disband his Army.</p>
               <p>And truly that was a moſt ſad day, in which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſollemnly prais'd and encourag'd his ſouldiers (as well as the occaſion permitted) he took his leave of them. For althuogh he bid them to be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort however, and told them he ſaw ſome day-light of a bleſſed peace, and that he did as much ſervice to the King by his preſent ſubmiſſion, as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his Martial atchievements; Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they all conceiv'd that that was the laſt day of the Kings authority in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all of them beleeved for certain, that thoſe Commands from the King were wreſted from him upon the apprehenſion of greater dangers to his perſon if he had not given them. And although ſome proviſion had been made by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in writing for their Indemnity, yet they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her have undergone the worſt that could fall, than ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive idle and unſerviceable ſpectators of the miſerable dition of their deareſt King. And it was no little vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conation to thoſe generous ſpirits, to think what an unworthy opinion forein Nations and their own poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt needs have of them, as if the Scotiſh Nation had been unanimouſly guilty of Rebellion and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo good a King. Beſides, their ſorow was much augmented with the conſideration that their General, who was moſt valiant, moſt ſucceſsfull, and therefore moſt beloved, ſhould be taken off ſo unhappily from the King, from his Country, from themſelvs, and all
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:116038:98"/>
good men. So that his ſouldiers falling down at his feet, entreated him with tears in their eyes, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſafety of the Kings perſon depended ſo much upon it, and he muſt of neceſſity depart the Kingdome, he would be pleaſed to take them along with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what part of the world ſoever he went. Profeſſing their readineſſe to live and fight any where under his command, and (if God would have it ſo) to die too. And truly many of them were reſolved, though to the certain hazard of their lives and eſtates, to follow him even againſt his will and knowledge, and to offer him that ſervice in an unknown land, that they were able to afford him no longer in their miſerable Country.</p>
               <p>By the Articles to which the King had conſented according to the deſires of the Covenanters, it was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially provided, that <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhould depart <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> before the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> and that they ſhould find him ſhipping, with proviſion and all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary when he went. Theſe things were tranſacted the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and a Port in <hi>Angus</hi> deſigned for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,</hi> whither they were to ſend ſhipping from whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was to imbark. And <hi>Montroſe</hi> to prevent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all occaſions of exception or ſuſpition, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied only with his own ſervants and a very few friends, betook himſelf thither, and waited for the ſhipping. About this time his moſt implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſet abroad crafty and feigned reports by their fit inſtruments, wherein they confidently averted, that <hi>the States of the Kingdome</hi> (as they call'd themſelvs) <hi>would by no means ſuffer that ſo gallant a Subject ſhould be baniſhed the Country: For they knew not how great
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116038:98"/>
need they might have of a man of his worth, eſpecially if the King who had caſt himſelf freely upon the affections of the</hi> Scots <hi>could not get any right of the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>but ſhould be put to ſeek it by force and arms; and if it came to that, no age had afforded a better General than</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe. And truly, that was the earneſt deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of moſt men, who were not able to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome of the Rebells plots: but they had far other deſigns in hand, and another game to play. For what their thoughts were towards the King, the ſad event made too manifeſt; and for <hi>Montroſe,</hi> they laid very unconſcionable and unworthy traps to catch him. For they did this, that if they could flatter him up with ſuch vain hopes, and entice him to ſtay in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome beyond his time appointed, they might take hold of him upon the Articles, and cut him off with more credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> was almoſt ſpent, and no news at all was to be had about the ſhipping or ſafe conduct: therefore <hi>Montroſe,</hi> (although he was reſolved to be gon by the day the King had limited) that he might more fully grope the intentions of the Covenanters, gave leave to ſome of his friends to deal with them for further time. But when they brought him nought but uncertain and doubtfull anſwers, he had reaſon to think they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing but to delude and intrap him. Beſides (which made his ſuſpition ſo much the greater) there came a ſhip upon the very laſt day allowed for his ſtay (to wit, on the laſt of <hi>Auguſt)</hi> into the haven of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe.</hi> The maſter of it was not only a ſtranger to him, but a moſt rude and violent abettor of the Rebells;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116038:99"/>
the Seamen and Souldiers men of the ſame temper, malicious, dogged, and ill-condition'd, the ſhip it ſelf neither victualled, not fit to go to Sea. So that when <hi>Montroſe</hi> ſhew'd himſelf ready to depart, and bad them hoiſe their ſailes aſſoon as they could, the Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſhip told him, that he muſt have ſome dayes allowed him to pitch and rigge his ſhip, before he durſt adventure himſelf to the wind and waves. And then making great brags of himſelf and his ſhip, he drew forth a Commiſſion which the Covenanters had given him, wherein he was required to tranſport the paſſengers to certain places aſſigned by themſelvs, and to carry no body elſe. Moreover there lay great Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſhips and men of War every day in ſight about the mouth of the river <hi>Eske</hi> (which makes the haven of <hi>Montroſe)</hi> attending there in favour of the Rebells for their much-deſired booty, that by no means he might eſcape their hands</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montroſe</hi> had ſufficient notice of their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and wanted not ſome friends of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelvs, who informed him by frequent meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the Sea was ſore peſter'd with the Engliſh Navy, and he could not eſcape ſafely either into <hi>France</hi> or the <hi>Low-Conntries;</hi> that the haven was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter block'd up, in which he was to take ſhipping, and therefore it was very perillous for him to go to Sea; that his enemies look'd for nothing elſe, than that either by making too long ſtay in his own Country he ſhould ſall into the hands of the Scotiſh Covenanters, or by going ſhould be ſurpriſed unarm'd and unawares by the Engliſh Rebells. <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116038:99"/>
friends that were with him were of opinion, that it was beſt for him in ſo apparent a danger to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Highlands, and draw his men together again, conceiving that he had better truſt the fortune of War than ſo perfidious a peace. But he forbore to take that courſe, eſpecially becauſe of his moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the King: For he was aſſured, if the War brake forth again it would be laid upon the King though undeſervedly, and ſo he ſhould bring his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into preſent danger, perhaps as much as his life was worth. Therefore being ſtraightned on every ſide, one way with treachery plotted againſt his own, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other againſt the Kings anointed head, he determined with an unalterable reſolution to bear all the burden upon his own ſhoulders. And therefore he withdrew himſelf, not out of raſhneſſe as if he deſpair'd of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the worſt, but out of ſage and diſcreet delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For when he had ſmelt out the plots of the Rebels before-hand, he had ſent ſome a good while ago to ſearch diligently the havens in the North, and if they chanced to find any outlandiſh veſſell, to agree with the Maſter for the fraught, and to appoint him to be ready to put to ſea at ſuch a day, and to tranſport the paſſengers (which ſhould be ready with him) by the help of God into <hi>Norway.</hi> By good fortune there was found in the haven of <hi>Stanhyve</hi> a ſmall bark of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> and the Maſter was ſoon agreed with for he was very glad of the opportunity, having hopes of getting.

            <head>The Continuation of <hi>Montroſe's</hi> Hiſtorie</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not our purpoſe in this addition to the Hiſtorie of the famous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, to deliver his ſeveral Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations with forein Princes further than in the general. For howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were in order to the Cauſe he had in hand, and did add a great deal of luſtre and ſplendour to his worth, in the eyes of ſtrangers, who were indifferent in the caſe; As likewiſe it muſt be confeſſed, that no ſubject of that Kingdome ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived higher favours abroad, or procur'd greater reſpect to the addreſſes made in his Maſters name; Yet theſe things being but obſcurely known in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them, except only to thoſe that were employ'd and indeed not ſo proper for our intention in this brief narration, which is to ſatisfie the curioſity of all, in the manner of his laſt entrie, his defeat, death, and buriall, if (it may be ſo call'd) Things for ought I know as yet, ſet down in no certain relation: We ſhall therefore ſetting aſide his Forein endeavours, bring him upon the ſame ſtage where his Tragedie had both its beginning and ending. Only that you may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:116038:101"/>
have a more lively repreſentation of his perſonal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, we ſhall give you to underſtand in what high eſtimation the Marqueſſe was with Forein Princes, as well as with thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and point at thoſe honours which did ſeem to court his magnanimitie beyond Seas. In <hi>France,</hi> with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of the Princes of the blood, and the reſt of the Nobility, he was deſign'd Chaptain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all the ſtrangers in that Kingdome; A truſt (which thoſe know that are acquainted with the Warrs of <hi>France)</hi> of very high conſequence, for in them conſiſts the whole ſtrength of the Kingdome. But this advancement of the Marqueſſes, was by Cardinall <hi>Mazarine</hi> croſſed or delayd, (who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a profeſſed enemy to Scots in that Kingdome.) From thence he took his journey to <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Prince then was, in purſute of his former intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but there he met with as great croſſes and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he had done in the bowels of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> who was his irreconcilable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now his competitor, and being then at the <hi>Hague</hi> labour'd by all means poſſible to undermine or prevent the Marqueſſes deſigns. With him were the Earl of <hi>Lautherdale,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Calender,</hi> men both of eminent parts, whom the Duke by ſeveral engagements had made firm to his purpoſes; They were both very earneſt for a Commiſſion. The Duke having intereſt in the Prince by blood, could not think that any in that truſt, could juſtly be preferred before him; alleging likewiſe that he might be more able to perform any deſign in that Kingdome, his kindred
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:116038:101"/>
and allies, and thoſe of his Name being very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and in the very heart of the kingdome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s ſouldiers, whom he truſted moſt, and employed in his former action, were either kill'd or diſperſed; And thoſe whom he had left, ſo terrified, and ſqueezed in their eſtates, that they were utterly unable to help him. On the other part the Marqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fidelity pleaded much for him, his notable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, his poor and ſlender beginnings, which made him ſo much the more capable for that underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it being requiſite the Prince ſhould employ ſuch an inſtrument (as the caſe then ſtood) being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all means to help him. The Prince who knew how needfull it was to reconcile two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſons, who being joyn'd might draw the greateſt part of that kingdome after them (fayling of which either of them was ſure to oppoſe the other that ſhould be employd,) made it his main drift to unite them. Several meetings were appointed to this purpoſe, but all in vain, neither could any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry prevail to make an agreement, ſo inveterate was their malice each to other, ſo jealous were they one of anothers proceedings. This variance made a long demur in that expedition, which was far ſooner intended. The cauſes of which were partly ſet down in the beginning of the Hiſtorie, and partly hatched by the Duke himſelf, who looking, as he was a man very ambitious of honour, upon all the Marqueſſes actions with a ſquint eye, fretted much that there was any within the ſame kingdome, who ſo farr ſurpaſſed him in gallantrie and eſteem: nor could he brook that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116038:102"/>
any one ſhould poſſeſſe the Kings ear ſo much as he, and for theſe reaſons he employed his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in defeating all <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s enterpriſes. But his Brothers known diſſervices, and bad ſucceſſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his own neglect, or ill managing of buſineſſe at <hi>Strivling</hi> bridge, much retarded and obſcured his claym to the Kings favour, in the particular he ſought for. And to ſpeak impartially, the Marqueſſes worth and experience was ſuch, that it did eaſily ſway the ballance in an indifferent mans judgement, even though the other two had been thrown in to make up the weight. The Marqueſſe having againſt his will ſpent a great deal of time in theſe diſputes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted at laſt from <hi>Holland,</hi> and travell'd up into <hi>Germanie,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Emperour, who in his late warrs againſt the <hi>Swede,</hi> hath been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfull, hearing of his arrivall, invited him to his Court, and amongſt many other honours conferr'd upon him, freely proferr'd him the Command of ten thouſand men; which ſhould be a ſtanding Army, conſtantly to be recruited; With free power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage at his own diſcretion, without receiving orders from any but the Empero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r himſelf. Which charge the Marqueſſe being willing to accept, and about to receive, (yet rather that he might if it were poſſible advance that cauſe which he had in hand, than for any deſire of honour) he was prevented by that happy peace concluded betwixt the Emperour &amp; the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which all who love the Common good of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wiſh to be laſting and perpetual. Being from thence very honourably diſmiſs'd, he addreſſes himſelf
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116038:102"/>
to the Dukes of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> and <hi>Holſteyn;</hi> from the laſt of which, he receiv'd thoſe ſhips which were kept a great while at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to no purpoſe, being three or four very fair veſſels and well mann'd. Which Prince would have willingly contributed more to that ſervice, but that he perceiv'd that which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, to be ſo miſemployed; wherein both he and the Marqueſſe were groſsly abus'd, as in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation ſhall appear. Great were the promiſes which had been made to the Marqueſſe by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, but they proved very ſlack in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, ſo that the aſſiſtance which was ſo generally expected, proved nothing elſe but a meer formalitie &amp; complement. But the ſeaſon of the year being now fit for action, he reſolves with what ſpeed he can to call together thoſe he could get, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe removes to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> from whence he might have a convenient paſſage to the Northern Iſles of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But ere we further proceed, it will not be imperrinent to our purpoſe, to take a ſlender view of that kingdom, whither this expedition was intended, and of the condition wherin it then was. <hi>Scotland</hi> was then in a reaſonable poſture of quiet, for the old grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by taking away the heads of factions (wherof ſome had ſuffer'd after <hi>Philip Haugh,</hi> and others were detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Priſoners in <hi>England)</hi> were tak'd up for a while. And a certain number of Horſe and Foot modell'd into an Army, was muſter'd and diſpos'd of in ſeveral places of the Kingdom, to prevent any forein inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or homebred inſurrection which might happen. Theſe were commanded by <hi>David Leſley,</hi> Colonel
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116038:103"/>
               <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> Colonel <hi>Straughan,</hi> &amp;c. being in all fifteen hundred Horſe, and three thouſand Foot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieut. General <hi>Holborn.</hi> This handful did at that time over-awe and keep under the diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted party, though far more powerful. For beſides thoſe which had been disbanded by the Earl of <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and Major General <hi>Munroe,</hi> at the bridge of <hi>Striveling,</hi> there flock'd dayly out of <hi>England</hi> great companies of thoſe who had eſcaped out of priſon; who finding their eſtates Sequeſtered, and feiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and withall moſt tyrannically proceeded againſt by the hot-ſpirited Miniſtery, deſired nothing more than an oportunity of revenge. Beſides theſe he had a conſiderable number of his own name and faction in the North. The <hi>Gordons,</hi> the <hi>Athole-</hi>men, who (if he had not been cruſh'd at his firſt entry) would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have aſſiſted him. This condition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, made the Marqueſs appear like a prodigious Mereor hanging over their heads, which awak'd thoſe who ſat at the helm of the State (whom it did indeed moſt concern) to endeavour the defeating of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, both at home and abroad. For this purpoſe was there a ſolemn Meſſage diſpatch'd to the Prince, then Reſident at the <hi>Hague,</hi> whom preſently upon the news of his Fathers death they proclam'd King, inviting him home upon certain conditions which were publiſh'd in this Kingdom, and need not therefore be inſerted. In the mean time the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs who had now gathered together a company of gallant Gentlemen as well Engliſh as Scots, makes all poſſible haſte diſpatches Colonel <hi>John Ogilby</hi> to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:116038:103"/>
               <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to entertain ſuch ſtrangers as might be for his purpoſe; But he forgeting his Commiſſion, beſtowed both moneys and pains in entertaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſuffering thoſe, who upon any terms would have engaged, to ſhift for themſelves. There being a great number who had fled out of <hi>England,</hi> and more who had lately deſerted the <hi>French,</hi> or been caſhier'd from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſervice. Thus were theſe goodly Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſufficiently provided for ſervice, loſt by his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and a limb of the deſign broken. There hapned about this time another buſineſs, which did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the Marqueſſes affairs. Colonel <hi>Cochran</hi> who had been diſpatched Commiſſioner into <hi>Poland</hi> to the Scotiſh Merchants, there to require their aſſiſtance, having procured very conſiderable ſums of money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſcore, and other proviſion for the furthering of that expedition, diſpos'd of the mony for his own uſes, made ſale of the corn and proviſion, together with the Veſſel which was provided for the tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, and did himſelf turn tail to the quarrel. This was another diſappointment. General <hi>King</hi> likewiſe (whom the Marqueſs expected out of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> with a conſiderable party of Horſe) either could not be ready ſo ſoon as was expected, or elſe delayed the time of purpoſe. But the Marqueſs (as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) feating leſt he ſhould have an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to deſiſt from his purpoſe, becauſe the Treaty betwixt the Prince and the Scotiſh Commiſſioners was now very near a concluſion, did precipitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; thoſe that were with him, into a moſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ruine. Now all thoſe great leavies, and aydes;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:116038:104"/>
Thoſe mighty preparations for the invaſion of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſettled in a poſture of war, and well forwarn'd of his imentions, amounted not above the number of ſix or ſeven hundred at the moſt, ſtrangers and all. The Common ſouldiers which adventur'd over with him, moſt of them <hi>Holſteyners</hi> or <hi>Hamburgers.</hi> He had ſent him by the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the arming of ſuch Gentle-men as ſhould upon his arrivall betake themſelves to his party, fifteen hundred arms, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat for Horſe, back, breſt, head-piece, Carbines, Piſtolls, and Swords, all which, (after his defeat in <hi>Cathanes)</hi> were taken untouch'd. With this ſmall preparation it was a deſperate action to attempt ſo mighty a buſineſs. And although his touching firſt upon the Iſlands, did encreaſe his number, and gave him almoſt the beginning of an Army; Yet were thoſe barbarous people ſo raw and unacquainted with diſcipline, that they proved in a manner uſeleſſe and unſerviceable. 'Tis true, the Inhabitants of thoſe Iſles, were a people in former times, very fierce, and warlike, and have under their own Captains made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Impreſſions, into the very heart of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But whether it was the Policie of the late Kings, to leave them untrain'd, of purpoſe to break then natural fierceneſs, or becauſe their own Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains being quell'd or cut off, they car'd not much to engage under any other, certain it is, That kingdome for two hundred years laſt paſt, hath not made leſſe uſe of any they had under their juriſdiction, nor have they at this preſent leſſe opinion of any Scots, for Military courage and valour. And this may be alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:116038:104"/>
as a great cauſe of their remiſsneſſe and unwieldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whilſt they were in the Marqueſſes ſervice. I told you a little before of <hi>Montroſe</hi>'s whole Strength, which did accompany him from <hi>Germany,</hi> whereof two ſhips, with neer upon a third part were ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but by ſtorm of weather (which is both frequent and dangerous) amongſt thoſe Northern Iſlands, they were loſt, with all the men and arms, nothing ſav'd. This was another check, and as it were a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a fore-runner of the ſad event which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the buſineſſe being fatal, he muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his own endeavours towards that deſtruction which his cruell fortune had provided for him. For he nothing terrified with this ſucceſſe, ſends out a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond party, which making a more proſperous voyage, landed at <hi>Orkney,</hi> and enter'd the Iſland without any reſiſtance. There being at that time no Garriſon or defence placed in any of thoſe Iſlands, by the States of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Together with theſe he ſent ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for levying of Horſe and Foot. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there were ſeveral diſpatch'd to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Iſlands adjacent for that purpoſe. The people of the Country being in no condition to reſiſt theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, endeavoured in hopes of favour as much as they could to further the deſign. A od thoſe who were not ſo earneſt, were by their own neighbours, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the cauſe, and theſe violent Commiſſioners, forc'd to take up Arms. Not long after landed the Marqueſs himſelf with the reſt of his company, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe Gentlemen which were reſolv'd ro par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his fortune: Amongſt whom were ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of note. Colonel <hi>Hurrey</hi> was there, a man who
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:116038:105"/>
had engaged in all quarrells, but never proſper'd in any. The Lord <hi>Frenderick,</hi> for his kinſman the Lord <hi>Napier,</hi> was left in <hi>Holland.</hi> Colonel <hi>Johnſon,</hi> a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute man, and an old ſouldier, Colonel <hi>Gray,</hi> a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſouldier, <hi>Harry Graham,</hi> his own natural bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Colonel <hi>James Hay</hi> of <hi>Naughton,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgetie, George Drummond</hi> of <hi>Ballach.</hi> For he had employed as was thought, Colonel <hi>Sibbalds</hi> his companion heretofore, as his Agent in <hi>Scotland;</hi> But he was apprehended at <hi>Muſſelburgh,</hi> and did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his General in death upon the ſame Scaffold. The Marqueſs continued a conſiderable time in <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> raiſing of Forces, and ſtrengthning himſelf with ſuch recruits, as the place would afford. Neither was there any preparation at all made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to diſpoſſeſs him of theſe Iſlands, either becauſe it might be thought a difficult buſineſſe to aſſail him within thoſe places naturally guarded with a rough and dangerous ſea; Or becauſe they knowing his ſtrength, expected a better opportunitie of him, as they found indeed within the Country.</p>
            <p>After this poor rabble of ſilly creatures was amaz'd, He reſolves at laſt to embarque, and to that purpoſe gathers all the boats he could find, ſhips his men, and in a ſhort ſpace lands them all upon the point of <hi>Cathanes,</hi> which is the fartheſt land to the North-weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The people having ſome experience of the carriage of his former ſouldierie, and now far more dreading the name of Foreiners, partly by the terrible reports which were conſtantly given out of him, fled away in heaps, many of them not ſtopping till they
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:116038:105"/>
came to the chief City <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there gave the terrible Alarm to the Parliament then ſitting. The Commanders were immediately ſummon'd, and charg'd with all poſſible haſte, to get the ſtanding Forces in readineſſe, and a Rendezvouz in order to the States command was hereupon preſently enjoyn'd at <hi>Breithen</hi> Northward. Colonel <hi>Stranghan,</hi> who was then in high eſteem with the great ones for his valour lately expreſſed in the Engliſh ſervice, and his zeal to the Presbyterian cauſe much extoll'd at that time, had an ample, and a particular. Commiſſion granted to him by the Parliament, to command a choice party of Horſe, which ſhould not be ſubject to <hi>David Leſleys</hi> orders, but might engage and fight with the enemy at his beſt advantage. With theſe, being not above three hundred, he advanced before the Army; <hi>David Leſley</hi> with the reſt of the Horſe, and <hi>Holborn</hi> with the Foot marching after him. In the mean time the Marqueſs advanc'd but very ſlowly, and that he might not be miſtaken, (ſince all the world was much aſtomiſhed at this Invaſion now whilſt the King was upon a Treatie) he publiſhed a Declaration; Wherein he labour'd to clear himſelf of any aſperſion of ſiniſter ends. That his intention was only againſt ſome particular perſons, who had againſt the Laws of the Kingdome, rais'd and maintain'd a war againſt the Kings Father, and did now by their ſubtile practices endeavour to deſtroy the Son alſo. That he intended nothing againſt the Generalitie of the Kingdom. Laſtly, exhorting all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Nation to endeavour to free themſelves from the Tyranny of thoſe who for the preſent ruled
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:116038:106"/>
the State, and the oppreſſion of the Miniſtrie. But the Country for ſeveral cauſes did not come to ſecond him as he expected. For the Earl of <hi>Sunder and,</hi> a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man in thoſe parts, his lands being next to the place where the Marqueſſe then was, rais'd a great power of his tenants and friends, and did his beſt to terrific and hinder all that were willing to joyn with him. And though he found himſelf unable to deal with the Marqueſſes Forces, yet did he ſtop all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe betwixt him and his friends. And thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who had heretofore followed him, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to aſſiſt him, knowing the danger of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, conſidering the fewneſſe of his number, and that his ſouldiers were much undiſciplin'd, and unlike to the former with whom he had done ſo great things, began to be averſe, and have a ſuſpicion of the event. Yet have I heard ſome ſay, which knew well enough the ſituation of that Country, that if he had not been oppreſſed in the nick, he might have gain'd ſuch ſtrengths amongſt the hills, as might have given him leiſure enough to have ſtrengthned his own party, and tyred out the enemy. Howſoever he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unmindfull of a retreat; there is in that Country a Caſtle call'd <hi>Dumbath,</hi> the Lord, or Laird thereof, is the head of a very antient Family, but no friend of the Marqueſſes. This Gentleman having left his houſe in the keeping of his Lady and ſome ſervants, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Lady, though the place were naturally fortified, yet upon ſummons delivered it to Colonel <hi>Hurry,</hi> who was ſent thither by the Marqueſs with a party of Foot to reduce it, upon condition her
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116038:106"/>
goods and eſtate might be ſecur'd, and ſhe with her ſervants ſuffer'd to march away. <hi>Hurrey</hi> having plac'd a Governour, and a Garriſon as he thought ſufficient for the defence of the place, return'd to the Marqueſs, who was now advanc'd to the place, or neer it, where he was to loſe at one throw both his life and fortune. The Marqueſſe hearing of the enemies approach, made his whole Forces march at a great trot to recover a paſſe, which they were not very far from, when he himſelf in the vanguard diſcover'd the firſt party, which was <hi>Straughans</hi> Forlorn hope, advancing very faſt upon him. So that theſe with their haſte and the ſouldiers running, found them both out of breath and order. The ſecond Party was commanded by <hi>Straughan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Rear-guard, as I remember, by Colonel <hi>Ker,</hi> for he had divided them in three bodies. But now the firſt party being very near, there was a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn hope of a hundred Foot drawn out to meet them, who giving fire upon them, put them to a diſorderly retreat, but being immediately ſeconded by <hi>Straugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> party, they made good their charge, and ſo terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iſlanders with that breach, that moſt of them threw down their Arms, and called for quarter. Only the Dutch Companies, after they had beſtowed a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley or two amongſt the Horſe, retreated into ſome ſhrubbs hard by, and there very valiantly defended themſelvs awhile, but were all taken at laſt. There were kill'd in this buſineſs to the number of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, twelve hundred taken, very few eſcaped. For the whole Country being in Arms, eſpecially <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> men (who came not to the fight, but to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution)
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:116038:107"/>
they kill'd or took Priſoners all ſuch as fled. In that skirmiſh was taken the Standard which he had caus'd to be made of purpoſe to move the affections of the people, with this Motto, <hi>Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord;</hi> and the portraict of the late King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, exactly well done. The Standard-bearer, a very gallant young Gentleman, was kill'd, after he had ſeveral times refuſed quarter. There was Colonel <hi>Hurrey</hi> taken, the Lord <hi>Frenderick,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgetie,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hay</hi> of <hi>Naughton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gray,</hi> and moſt of the Officers, and two Miniſters.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs, after he ſaw the day was abſolutely loſt, threw away his cloak, which had the Star on it, (having receiv'd the order of the Garter a little while before) his Sword was likewiſe found, and not very far off his horſe which he had forſaken. For ſo ſoon as he had got clear off that ground where the skirmiſh was, he betook himſelf to foot, and lighting upon one of that Country, or one of his own ſouldiers (I know not whether) took his Highland apparel from him, and ſo in that habit conveighed himſelf away. But ſuch narrow ſearch being made for him, he could not long eſcape, yet he continued in the open fields three or four days without any notice gotten of him. At laſt the Lord of <hi>Aſton,</hi> being in arms with ſome of his Tenants, &amp; aboard in that ſearch, happned on him. He had been one of his followers before. In that place he had continued three or four dayes, without meat or drink, with one only man in his company. The Marqueſſe knowing him, and believing to find friendſhip at his hands, willingly diſcover'd himſelf.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:116038:107"/>
But <hi>Aſton</hi> not daring to conceal him, and being gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the reward which was promiſed to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender by the Councel of State, ſeiz'd upon him, and diſarm'd him; 'tis ſaid he profered great ſumms for his liberty, which being in vain, he deſired to dye by the hands of thoſe who took him, rather than be made an object of miſery and ſhame (as he knew very well he ſhould) by his enraged enemies. But neither of his deſires was granted, but in place of them, a ſtrong guard ſet over him, and ſo conveyed to <hi>David Leſley. Sraughan</hi> having atchieved his buſineſs with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and freed the State from this much-fear'd danger, returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> leaving the reſt of the buſineſſe to <hi>Leſley</hi> and <hi>Holborn,</hi> where he receiv'd great rewards and thanks for his eminent ſervice; not without the great heart-burning of <hi>David Leſley,</hi> who ſeeing a rivall riſen up to his honour, and one whom he lookt upon as an upſtart ſouldier, have ſo great ſucceſſe, fretted not a little. Howſoever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he moves to accompliſh the reſt of the work, which was now of no great conſequence, for there reſted nothing within the Country, but only the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbath,</hi> which being out of all hopes of relief af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defeat, ſo ſoon as they were perfectly aſſur'd by ſome Priſoners whom they knew, yielded the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. The Governour was Priſoner at mercy; The ſouldiers being Dutch, were upon terms to return homewards. There was nothing elſe to be done ſave the reducing of the Iſlands, and the town of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> in <hi>Orkney,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Johnſon</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Harry Graham</hi> were left, when the Marqueſſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:116038:108"/>
paſs'd over to <hi>Cathanes;</hi> but <hi>Montroſe,</hi> either becauſe he could not ſpare any ſouldiers, or becauſe he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better ſucceſſe, had left them almoſt naked; though there were ſeveral places in thoſe Iſles which might have been made very renable. Colonel <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> having underſtooſt of the defeat, with thoſe that were with him, took ſhipping and returned from whence he came, ſo did <hi>Harry Graham</hi> likewiſe, elſe both of them had caſted of the ſame ſawce, which their General did. Thus <hi>Leſteys</hi> Forces entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance, ſeiz'd upon the Arms which <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> had brought thither, together with two pieces of Ordnance. The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had given him a little Friggot of ſixteen Guns which lay in the Harbour, the Maſter of which being gone aſhore into one of the Iſlands, the Company ſeeing the event of the buſineſſe, revolted, and brought in that likewiſe. The victorie being now compleat, there was a ſolemn day of thankſgiving appointed through the whole Kingdome, Bonfires, ſhooting of Ordnance, and other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of joy. But many of the Gentry who had been under his command before, having now engaged with him again, were no partakers in this joy. For ſome of his papers being taken, many of them were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered, and ſuffer'd in their eſtates. The Marqueſſe being now in the Cuſtodie of his mortal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, from whom he could not expect the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Yet expreſt a ſingular conſtancie, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a careleſeneſſe of his own condition. Comming to his Father-in-laws houſe, the Earl of <hi>Southesks,</hi> where two of his children were, he procur'd liberty
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:116038:108"/>
from his Guard to ſee them: but neither at meeting, or parting, could any change of his former counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be diſcern'd, or the leaſt expreſſion heard, which was not ſuitable to the greatneſſe of his ſpirit, and the ſame of his former actions. Tis memorable of the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> where he lodg'd one night, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough it had ſuffer'd more by his Army than any elſe within that kingdome, yet were they amongſt all the reſt ſo far from inſulting over him, that the whole Town teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a great deal of ſorrow for his wofull condition; and there was he likewiſe furniſhed with cloaths fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his birth and perſon. Being come to <hi>Leith,</hi> he was received by the Magiſtrates of the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſtaying a while there to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was afterward led towards the City, by that way which goes betwixt <hi>Leith,</hi> and the water-gate of the Abbey. And with him all the Priſoners of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on foot, betwixt thirty and fourty: but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had the favour to be mounted on a cart-horſe. Having ended this part of his journey with as much ſtate as in triumphs is accuſtomed to be, he was not at the end of the Cannon-Gate by ſome other Officers, and the Executioner in his Liverie Coat. Into whoſe hands he was delivered. There was fram'd for him a high ſeat in faſhion of a Chariot, upon each ſide of which were holes, through which a cord being drawn, and croſſing his breſt and arms, bound him faſt down in the Chayr. The Executioner (being commanded ſo to do) took off the Marqueſſes hat, put on his own b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnet, and the Chariot being drawn by four horſes, he mounted one of the firſt, and very ſolemnly began
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:116038:109"/>
to drive along towards the Tol-booth. The people who were aſſembled in great multitudes, and were many of them heretofore very deſirous to ſee this ſpectacle, could not now refrain from tears, and thoſe who had heretofore wiſhed him all misfortune, began to be ſhaken with the firſt ſcene of his Tragedy. But the implacable Miniſtrie having him now at their mercie, could never be ſatisfied with his calamities; They reviled him with all poſſible ſpite, objected fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to him his former condition, and his preſent miſerie, and pronounced heavy judgments againſt him: being come to the Toll-booth, he was very cloſely ſhut up, and ſtrong guards ſet upon him, all acceſſe denyed to him; no, not his Father-in-law, or any of his friends ſuffer'd to come nigh him. There he was a conſiderable time, all which the Miniſters never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exacerbate his miſery. Of whom one being asked why they could not otherwiſe be ſatisfied, but by ſo ignominious handling of him? He anſwered, They knew no other way to humble him, and bring him home to God.</p>
            <p>Certain it was, that all theſe diſgraces which were put upon him, were the only inventions of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly then ſitting, to whoſe wiſdomes the deviſing of his puniſhment was referr'd by the Councill of State. All this while the holy Covenant was preſs'd upon him with much vehemencie, which when he with much reaſon and conviction to them refus'd, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to their ordinary way of rayling, and maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and one of them was ſo bold to tell him, he was a faggot of hell, and he ſaw him burning there already.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:116038:109"/>
They urged alſo upon him as the price of his releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from excommunication, an open confeſſion of his faults, and an acknowledgment of the guilt of blood which had been ſhed the years paſt in which he had been in arms; but all to no purpoſe. But more particularly (becauſe the battell of <hi>Kilſyth</hi> had been loſt upon ſo great odds) he was much ſolicited to diſcover the Conſpiratours in the overthrow of that Army, but that took no effect; nor is it yet (ſince he left it undiſcover'd) known to any Scotiſh man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, whether there were any connivance in't or no. He was very frequent in his devotions, whilſt he was in priſon, and expreſt much more cheerfulneſſe than he had done at any time before ſince his being taken priſoner. After he had endur'd theſe private batteries and aſſaults, with a great deal of conſtancy, he was at laſt brought before a publick auditorie to be ſiſted. The Parliament had a little while before been called, for proclaming the King, and ordering the affairs of the Kingdome: whither he was brought, and did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with a very undiſmayd countenance, in a rich Mantle layd over with maſſie lace. His chief adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle,</hi> his known and invetetate enemy; Earl of <hi>Lowdon,</hi> the Chancellour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the ſame name &amp; faction, <hi>Lowdon Ker,</hi> a violent and high ſpirited man; <hi>Caſſells,</hi> another of his adverſaries, was gone in Commiſſion to the King. Theſe of the Nobility were moſt againſt him; Of the Gentry, the Laird of <hi>Swinton,</hi> a potent man in that Parliament: Sir <hi>James Stuart,</hi> Provoſt of the City of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:116038:110"/>
               <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a man likewiſe in great eſteem; the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> a Lord of the Seſſion, and Preſident of the Committee for Examinations, and ſeveral others. But the whole Aſſembly was violent againſt him, neither could he be admitted to any place there, that was not publickely invective againſt him. But amongſt them all the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in this ſtrife carried the honour, and of them Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Trayle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mungo Law,</hi> two ſuch vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachers, as no man that knows them can mention their names without deteſt. The firſt of the two, had been Chaplain before to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyle,</hi> and was his companion in his flight from the battel of <hi>Ennerlochie,</hi> and now Priſoner to the States of <hi>England.</hi> Many and grievous were the accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous laid to his charge. Firſt, that he had by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious inſinuation diverted the King from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of his well-wiſhing Subjects. The introducing the Iriſh into the bowells of the Kingdome. The murther of ſome particular perſons, the utter ſpoyl and devaſtation of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Argyles</hi> lands, and the killing and deſtroying of divers well-affected people, and that in cold blood. The cruel uſage of ſome miniſters at his laſt landing. The Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were there preſent, but could allege nothing, ſave only that he had reſtrain'd them from rayling. His tranſacting with forein States for the invaſion of his Native Country, and bringing in of Foreiners now the ſecond time, and that without any known Commiſſion. His obſtinate perſecution of all Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, againſt his own oath and engagement, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:116038:110"/>
his Apoſtacie from his firſt principles. The Marqueſs knowing how much his defences would avail him, did not much labour to clear himſelf, but anſwer'd all in general. For his Invaſion they knew partly what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he had, for the reſt he was ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his conſcience, that he had done nothing, which he might not be anſwerable to God for, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in order to his Maſters Commands, and to men too, ſo he might have but an even and an unprejudic'd judicatory. Thus having been called once or twice before that high Court of judgement, where he anſwer'd ſo vigorouſly as was admirable to all, he did at laſt receive his doleful Sentence, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed upon him two daye after, with all the ſeverity and bitterneſſe that could he deviſed. There was erected in the middle of the Market-place a large Scaffold, breſt-high, in the midſt of which, was planted a Gibbet of extraordinary height. The Marqueſſe having taken his reſt very kindly that night, next morning recommending himſelf unto God once or twice, took his breakfaſt very cheerfully. The Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs waited on him to the Scaffold, where the whole people of the City attended his comming at leaſt two hours before. He came uncovered all the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Scaffold and the Toll-booth, and in the ſame rich Mantle he had worn before. Being come thither, he was much detayn'd with a great many frivolous queſtions, of which, partly the Miniſters, partly thoſe whom the States ſuffer'd to be about him, deſir'd to be ſatisfied. Hee made a ſhort Speech, in which he was often interrupted, the Tenour of which was,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:116038:111"/>
that he was ſatisfied in his conſcience for ought he had done in relation to warr. That for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins (which were infinite) he had begg'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don earneſtly of God, and had an inward hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; He freely forgave all thoſe who had ſought his overthrow, and intreated the Charity of all the people, to pray both for him and them. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe he was under the ſentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, refus'd to pray for him, and even on the very Scaffold, were very bitter againſt him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had about a quarter of an hour prayed with his hat before his eyes, he was ready to goe to his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when his Book and Declaration, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers which he had publiſh'd in his life, being tyed in a ſtring together, were hang'd about his neck. He was very earneſt that he might have the liberty to keep on his hat, it was denyed; he requeſted he might have the privilege to keep his cloak about him, neither could that be granted. Then with a moſt undaunted courage he went up to the top of that prodigious gibbet, where having freely pardon'd the Executioner, he gave him three or four pieces of gold, and enquir'd of him how long he ſhould hang there, he told him three hours, then commanding him at the uplifting of his hands, to tumble him over, he was accordingly thruſt off by the weeping Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The whole people gave a general groan, and it was very obſervable, that even thoſe who at his firſt appearance had bitterly inveigh'd againſt him, could not now abſtain from tears. 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyles</hi> expreſſions had ſomething of grief in them, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:116038:111"/>
did likewiſe weep at the rehearſal of his death, (for he was not preſent at the Execution.) Howſoever they were by many call'd Crocodiles tears, how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily I leave to others Judgement. But I am ſure there did in his ſon, the Lord of <hi>Lorn,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no ſuch ſign, who neither had ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of heart to be ſorry, nor ſo much pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wit as to diſſemble; who entertaining his new Bride, (the Earl of <hi>Murrays</hi> Daughter) with this ſpectacle, mock'd and laugh'd in the midſt of that weeping Aſſembly: And ſtaying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſee him hewen in pieces, triumph'd at every ſtroak which was beſtow'd upon his mangled body. Thus ended the life of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Marqueſſe, though not his puniſhment, (if that can propetly be call'd a puniſhment which mens bodies ſuffer after death.) For being cut down, without ſo much as any to receive his falling Corps, his Head was ſmitten off, his arms by the ſhoulders, and his leggs by the knees, and ſo put into ſeveral boxes, made for the purpoſe; the reſt of his body was by three or four Porters, carryed out to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique place of Execution, call'd the <hi>Borrow moor,</hi> anſwerable to that of <hi>Tyborn</hi> by <hi>London,</hi> but wall'd about, and there was it thrown into a hole, where afterwards it was digg'd up by night, and the linnen in which it was folded ſtoln away. His Head was fix'd upon the Toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth, over againſt the Earl of <hi>Gowries,</hi> with an Iron Croſſe over it, leſt by any of his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:116038:112"/>
friends it ſhould have been taken down; the reſt of his parts were diſpatch'd to the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent places of the Kingdome, to <hi>Sterling, Dundee, Glaſgow, Aberdeen,</hi> which were all taken down afterwards by the Engliſh, or their permiſſion. But the Tragedie was not yet full, for <hi>Hurrie</hi> was the next in that bloody roll, who pleading the benefit of quarter, and a great charge of Children, thought to have taſted of the Parliaments mercy. But he was condemn'd notwithſtanding, to loſe his head in the ſame place, Jealous they were of him before, when he was engaged in their ſervice againſt <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe,</hi> but could not produce any ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The chief accuſations wherewith he was charg'd, the laſt Invaſion with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, and his former carrying Arms againſt them under Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Marſton Moor.</hi> VVith him ſuffer'd young <hi>Spotſwood</hi> of <hi>Daerſie,</hi> a compleat young Gentleman, and very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of pitty, (if any had been ſhown) being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, but an excellent ſpirit, and a good Scholar. The next couple was Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgeſie,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Sibbalds:</hi> than which two the Nation could not afford two more accompliſhed for perſon, and parts. The firſt being a Catholick, (and therefore not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under the Compaſſe of the Miniſters Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) without ſpeaking a word to any body, but throwing ſome Papers out of his pocket, took off his doublet, kiſs'd the fatal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116038:112"/>
kneeled down, and receiv'd the blow. The other, with a little more vigour, ſmil'd a while, and talk'd to the diſorderly rabble that was about him: then with ſuch an Heroick geſture march'd to the block, as if he had been to act a gallant in a Play. The end of the laſt man was ſomewhat Comical, though the poor Gentleman loſt his life. His name was Captain <hi>Charters,</hi> of an honourable and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Familie in that Kingdome. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters having dealt with him to acknowledge his fault publikely, and dehort all others from it (which from no other of his Companions they could ever extort) he, though reſolute enough, and a good Scholar, yet partly by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Friends, and partly by weakneſſe which was occaſion'd by his wounds, agreed to their deſire, and was content to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Manifeſto, in hopes his life might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. With this conqueſt of Conſcience, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters (to produce their great work to the Common people) came vaunting upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Hee all this while ſuſpecting nothing leſſe than death, made a long and tedious <hi>Harangue</hi> to the people, wherein he acknowledged his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie from the Covenant, and other things which he had vented in auricular confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Miniſters; which very energetically they had pend for him. In lieu of granting his life which he expected, (leſt he ſhould fall off from his principles which he had openly proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:116038:113"/>
as ſome of their converts had done before) fairly they cut off his Head, and ſealed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with his blood. The reſt being for the moſt part ſtrangers, or ſuch as had ſpent moſt part of their time in ſervice abroad, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, after Bond given not to enter the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome again, in a hoſtile manner.</p>

            <p>THe Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being informed that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe</hi> was taken, and fore-ſeeing that his countenance and carriage might gain him ſome favour amongſt the People, though fit to give out their ſentence againſt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould come to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And therefore upon the 17. of <hi>May anno</hi> 1650. in the morning, they appointed a Committee to prepare and give in their opinions what was fitteſt to be done with him, where the ſame fore-noon they gave in their report in writing to this effect: That ſo ſoon as he ſhould come to the Town, he ſhould be met at the Gate by the Magiſtrates, and Hangman; That he ſhould be tyed with cords upon a Cart bareheaded, and the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:116038:114"/>
Hangman to ride upon the horſe that drew the Cart, covered before him, and ſo to be brought through the Town. That he ſhould be hanged on a Gibbet at the Croſſe of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> untill he died, his Hiſtorie, and Declaration hanging about his neck, and ſo hang three hours in publick view of all the people: after which he ſhould be behended, and quartered. His head to be fixt upon the Priſon houſe of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and his legs and arms over the gates of the Cities of <hi>Sterling, Glaſcow, Perth,</hi> alias Saint <hi>Johns-Town,</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> And in caſe he repented, (whereby the Sentence of Excommunication may be taken off by the Church); the bulck of his body ſhould be buried in the <hi>Gray-Fryers;</hi> if not, to be buried in the <hi>Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 18. day about four a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, he was brought in at the Water-gate, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sentence, was met by the Magiſtrates, the guards, and the Hangman of the Citie, the reſt of the Priſoners being tyed two and two together, going bare-headed before him. So ſoon as he came within the gate, the Magiſtrates ſhewed him the Sentence, which when he had read, and perceived the Cart, and the Hangman there ready, he ſaid; <hi>He would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey, he was only ſorry that through him, his Majeſty whoſe perſon he preſented, ſhould be ſo diſhonoured.</hi> Then going cheerfully into the Cart, he being unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, was by the Hangman tyed thereunto with ropes, and the Hangman on the horſe rid covered; thus was he carried to the Priſon, and in all the way, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him ſuch a <hi>Majeſty, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:116038:114"/>
no way <hi>Daunted,</hi> That his very Enemies, nay common women, who as it was believed by divers, would have ſtoned him in the Cart as he paſſed, were upon the ſight of him ſo aſtoniſhed, and moved, that their intended curſes were turned into tears and Prayers for him; Inſomuch as the next day (being Sunday,) the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preached againſt them for not reviling and ſtoning of him as he paſſed along.</p>
            <p>When he was taken from the Cart, he gave the Hangman gold, telling him, <hi>That was a reward for driving the Cart.</hi> It was ſeven a clock at night before he was entered into the Priſon, and immediately the Parliament met, and ſent ſome of their Members, and ſome Miniſters to examine him; but he refuſed to anſwer any thing to them, untill he was ſatisfied upon what tearms they ſtood with the King, his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Maſter; Which being reported unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ceaſed proceeding againſt him until <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and allowed their Commiſſioners to tell him, that the King and they were agreed: He deſired to be at reſt, for he was weary with a long journey, and he ſaid, <hi>The Complement they had put upon him that day was ſomewhat tedious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> he was conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Miniſters and Parliament men, who ſtill purſued him with threatnings, but they got no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him; he told them, <hi>they thought they had affronted him the day before by carrying him in a Cart, but they were much miſtaken; For he thought it the moſt Honourable and joyfull'ſt journey that ever he made, God having all the while moſt comfortably manifeſted his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> in the forenoon, he was brought before the Parliament, and after the delivery of a long penned diſcourſe by the Chancellour, wherein he was pleaſed to take notice of <hi>his miſcariages againſT the firſt Covenant, the League and Covenant, his Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and joyning with the Iriſh Rebels, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>ineſs; and that now, how God had brought him to juſt puniſhment:</hi> He deſired to know if he might be allowed to ſpeak for himſelf, which being granted, he ſaid, <hi>Since you have declared unto me, that you have agreed with the King, I look upon you, as if his Majesty were ſitting amongſt you; and in that Relation I appear with this reverence, bare-headed: My care hath been alwayes to walk as became a good Chriſtian, and a loyal Subject; I engaged in the firſt Covenant, and was faithfull to it, untill I perceived ſome private perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Religion intended to wring the Authority from the King, and to ſeize on it for themſelves; and when it was thought fit, for the clearing of honeſt men, that a bond ſhould be ſubſcribed, wherein the ſecurity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was ſufficiently provided for, I ſubſcribed. For the League and Covenant, I thank God I was never in it, and ſo could not break it; but how farr Religion hath been advanced by it, and the ſad conſequences that have followed on it, theſe poor diſtreſſed Kingdoms can witneſſe; for when his late Majeſty had by the bleſſing of God almoſt ſubdued thoſe enemies that roſe againſt him in</hi> England, <hi>and that a faction of this Kingdome went
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:116038:115"/>
in to the aſſiſtance of them; His Majeſty gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to me, to come into this Kingdom, and to make a diverſion of thoſe forces that were going from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him. I acknowledged the command moſt juſt, and I conceiv'd my ſelf bound in conſcience and duty to obey it. What my carriage was in this Country, many of you may bear witneſſe; Diſorders in any Army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prevented, but they were no ſooner known, than puniſhed; never was any blood ſpilt but in battel, and even then many thouſand lives have I preſerved; and as I came in upon his Majeſties Warrant, So upon his Letters did I lay aſide all intereſt, and retreated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for my comming in at this time, it was by his Majeſties command, in order to the accelerating of the Treaty betwixt him and you; His Majeſtie knowing, that when ever he had ended with you, I was ready to retire upon his call. I may juſtly ſay, that never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject acted upon more Honourable grounds, nor by a more lawful power, than I did in this ſervice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire you to lay aſide prejudice, and conſider me as a Chriſtian in relation to the juſtice of the quarrel; as a Subject in relation to my Royal Maſters commands; and as your Neighbour in relation to the many of your lives I have preſerved in battel; and be not too raſh, but let me be judged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and Nations, and the Laws of this Land; if you do otherwiſe, I do hear appeal from you, to the Righteous judge of the world, who one day muſt be both your judge and mine, and who alwayes gives Righteous judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he delivered with ſuch Gravity, and without
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:116038:116"/>
Paſſion, as was much admired even of his enemies. After which, the Chancellour commanded the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be read, which he heard with a ſetled and an unmoved countenance, and deſiring to be further heard, was preſently ſtopt by the Chancellour, who commanded he ſhould be preſently removed back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to priſon; where being no ſooner come, but the Miniſters aſſault him afreſh, aggravating the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Sentence, thereby to affright him. He acknowledged himſelf much beholding to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Honour they put upon him, ſaying, <hi>He took it for a greater honour to have his head ſtand upon the Priſon Gate for this quarrel, than to have his picture in the Kings Bed-chamber. And (leſt his Loyaltie ſhould be forgotten) they had highly honoured him, in deſigning laſting monuments to four of the chiefeſt Cities, to bear up his memorial to all poſterity; Wiſhing he had had fleſh enough, to have ſent a piece to every City in Chriſtendome, to witneſſe his loyalty to his King and Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Friends were not ſuffered to come near him, but a guard was alwayes in the Chamber with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he had neither time, nor place for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, but in their hearing.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 21. Cloathed in a Scarlet cloak richly laced with Gold lace, he was brought to the Scaffold: He came along the Streets with ſo great ſtate, and there appeared in his countenance ſo much Beauty, Majeſty and Gravity, as amazed the beholders; and many even of his Enemies did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the gallanteſt ſubject in the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:116038:116"/>
World: but becauſe all his Friends and well-willers were debar'd from comming near him, there was a boy deſigned for that purpoſe on the Scaffold, who took his laſt Speech, Which was to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ſorry if this manner of my End be ſcandalous to any good Chriſtian. Doth it not often happen to the righteous according to the wayes of the wicked, and to the wicked, according to the wayes of the righteous? doth not ſometime a juſt man periſh in his righteouſneſs, and a wicked man proſper in his malice? They who know me, ſhould not diſeſteem me for this; many greater than I have been dealt with in this kind; yet I muſt not ſay, but that all Gods Judgements are Juſt; For my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſins, I acknowledge this to be juſt with God, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf to him: but in regard of man, I may ſay, they are but inſtruments, God forgive them, I forgive them, they have oppreſſed the poor, and violently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Judgement and Juſtice, but he that is higher than they, will reward them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What I did in this Kingdome, was in obedience to the moſt juſt Commands of my Soveraign, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the day of his diſtreſſe, againſt thoſe that roſe up againſt him. I acknowledge nothing, but fear God and Honour the King, according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the Law of Nature, and Nations, and I have not ſinned againſt man, but againſt God, and with him there is Mercy, which is the ground of my drawing neer unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is objected againſt me by many, (even good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,) That I am under the Cenſure of the Church; This is not my fault, ſince it is only for doing my Duty, by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:116038:117"/>
obeying my Prince's moſt juſt Commands, for Religion, His Sacred Perſon, and Authority. Yet I am ſorry they did Excommunicate me, &amp; in that which is according to Gods Laws, without wronging my Conſcience or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance. I deſire to be relaxed; if they will not do it, I appeal to God who is the righteous Judge of the world, and who muſt, and will, I hope, be my Judge and Svi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſpoken of me, that I ſhould blame the King (God forbid,) For the late King, he lived a Saint, and dyed a Martyr; I pray God, I may ſo end as He did; If ever I ſhould wiſh my Soul in another mans ſtead, it ſhould be in his. For his Majeſty now living, never people I believe might be more happy in a King: His Commands to me were moſt juſt; in nothing that he promiſeth will he fail. He deals juſtly with all men, I pray God he be ſo dealt withall, that he be not betrayed under truſt, as His Father was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſire not to be miſtaken, as if my carriage at this time in Relation to your waies were ſtubborn; I do but follow the light of my own Conſcience, which is ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the working of the good Spirit of God that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, I thank him, I go to Heavens Throne with joy. If He enable me againſt the fear of Death, and furniſh me with courage, and conſidence to imbrace it even in its moſt ugly ſhape, Let God be glorified in my end, though it were in my damnation. Yet I ſay not this out of any fear or diſtruſt, but out of my duty to God, and Love to his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have no more to ſay, but that I deſire your Charity and Prayers. I ſhall pray for you all. I leave my

Soul to God, my Service to my Prince, my Good will to my Friends, and my Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Being deſired to pray apart, He ſaid, <hi>I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready powred out my Soul before the Lord who knows my heart, and into whoſe hands I have commended my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he hath been graciouſly pleaſed to return to me a full aſſurance of peace in Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer, and therefore if you will not joyn with me in prayer, my rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating again will be both Scandalous to you, and me.</hi> So cloſing his eyes, and holding up his hands, he ſtood a good ſpace at his inward devotions, being perceived to be inwardly moved all the while; When he had done, he call'd for the Executioner, and gave him mony. Then having brought unto him (hanging in a cord) his Declaration, and Hiſtory, he hanged them about his neck, ſaying, <hi>Thongh it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed His Sacred Majeſty that now is, to make him one of the Knights of the moſt Honourable Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he did not think himſelf more Honoured by the Garter, than by that cord with the Books, which he would embrace about his neck with as much joy and content, as ever he did the Garter, or a chain of gold,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired them to be tied unto him as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>When this was done, and his ams tyed, he asked the Officers, <hi>If they had any more Diſhonour, as they conceived it, to put upon him, he was ready to accept it.</hi> And ſo with an undaunted Courage and Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſuffered, according to the Sentence paſt upon him.</p>

THe death of the noble Marqueſſe was not bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as a private loſſe, but rather as a publique ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. The greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> expreſſed no ſmall ſorrow for his unhappy end. And indeed we have not had in this latter Age a man of more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts either of body or of mind. He was a man not very tall, nor much exceeding a middle ſtature, but of exceeding ſtrong compoſition of body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible force, with excellent proportion and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Dark brown hayr'd, ſanguine complexion, a ſwift and peircing gray eye, with a high noſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the antient ſigne of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namity. He was of a moſt reſolute and undaunted ſpirit, which began to appear in him, to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and expectation of all men, even in his childhood. Whom would it not have ſtartled to attempt as he did at his firſt entry into <hi>Scotland,</hi> a journey where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he could not almoſt eſcape diſcovery, all paſſes being ſo laid for him, but even when he was known, and almoſt made publike, he proceeded in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He was a man of a very Princely courage, and excellent addreſſes, which made him for the moſt part be us'd by all Princes with extraordinary familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; A compleat Horſeman, and had a ſingular grace in riding. Nor is it leſſe wonderful, how in ſo great ſcarcity of all things, when warre in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is but tedious with the greateſt plenty it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, he could patiently endure ſo much diſtreſſe. Nor is it leſſe to be wondred at, how he could win ſo much upon thoſe Iriſh, who had no tie to him either
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:116038:118"/>
of Country, Language or Religion, as he did. More eſpecially when they wanted not all manner of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that either their own miſeries and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty could ſuggeſt, or the wit and ſagacity of the enemy could invent to make them leave him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the ſervice. Beſides, the many examples ſhown upon them, and their continual want of Pay, either of which accidents in an Army is ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and has been many times the occaſion of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny and deſertion. Nor had he only an excellent and mature judgement for providing and forecaſting of buſineſſe, but a prompt and ready ſpirit likewiſe in matters of preſent danger and ſudden calamity, and theſe things which might have confuſed another another mans underſtanding, as ſuch ſudden chances often doe, were a whetting to his wit. There are many ſtratagems in ſeveral Hiſtories related, which in the heat of action have been put in practice for the regaining of a day already loſt, or in danger to be ſo. As that of <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> a politick and valiant Prince, who in the heat of a battel betwixt him and <hi>Marius</hi> the Roman Conſul, rode up and down in the head of the Army, ſhowing his bloody ſword, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had ſlain <hi>Marius</hi> with his own hand, which word did ſo encourage the <hi>Numidians,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the <hi>Romans,</hi> that had not <hi>Marius</hi> in time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that day had been in hazard. It is likewiſe reported of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, that he flung his Standard amongſt the middle of the enemie, that his own Souldiers by preſſing forward to reſcue it, might break and diſorder the enemy. Likewiſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:116038:119"/>
of another that took the bridles off the horſe-heads, that every man might be a like valiant, and charge, as we ſay, without fear or wit. But beyond all theſe, in my opinion, was that device of the Marqueſſes, who at <hi>Alderne</hi> being in a great ſtraight, one wing of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being routed, and the other in a very ſtaggering condition, he did ſo incenſe that which was yet whole, with the feigned ſucceſs of the other, that they valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged the enemy, and put the buſineſſe again into an even ballance. And very like was it to that device of <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> who being deſerted by <hi>Metius</hi> King of the <hi>Albans,</hi> told his ſouldiers he had don't of purpoſe to try them, and by that means turned their fear into indignation. He was exceeding conſtant and loving to thoſe that did adhere to him, and to thoſe he knew, very affable, though his carriage, which indeed was not ordinary, did make him ſeem proud; Nor can his enemies lay any greater fault to his charge, than his inſatiable deſire of honour, which he did purſue with as handſome and heroick actions as ever any did, and ſuch as had neither admixtion of avarice or ſelf-ends, though he was therewith by ſome moſt unworthily branded. For theſe and the like vertues of which he was the rich poſſeſſour, he was lamented all Chriſtendom over, by all ſorts of men, &amp; ſince his death too by thoſe who had the greateſt hand in't, though their ſucceſſe at that time did animate their cruelty.</p>

            <head>The Speech of Collonel <hi>William Sybbald</hi> intended by him to have been ſpoken on the Scaffold at the time of his Execution at <hi>Edinborough, Jan.</hi> 7. 1650. but hearing that Liberty would not be given him to ſpeak ſo freely, he gave a Copie of it to a ſpecial friend.</head>
            <p>GEntlemen, I am brought this day to this place, to pay a debt to Nature before it be due; and by the malice and cruelty of my mercyleſſe enemies, I am ſentenced to dye as a Traytor to my Country, for endeavouring to do ſervice for my King, on whoſe happineſſe and wel-fare does depend the wel-fare of theſe Kingdoms; and to whom I am bound both by the Law of God and man to perform all faithful and loyal ſervice: And as the cauſe for which I ſuffer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clames my loyalty, ſo their Sentence does declare to all the world their diſloyalty, and their intentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King.</p>
            <p>Their ſelf-guiltineſſe makes cowardly ſpirits cruel; and ſuch was their proceedings againſt me, as that I could not obtain an Advocate to plead for me, nor any man skilful in the Laws, either to adviſe with me, or to write my Defence, though they knew me to be ignorant of the Laws. Thus is my innocencie and integrity betrayed, partly by their malice, and my own ignorance.</p>
            <p>The truth is, they did profer to do me any courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or favour, if I would make an ingenuous confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:116038:120"/>
that is, accuſe ſome Noblemen and Gentlemen of keeping correſpondency with his Majeſty, or with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe;</hi> which if I had done, I deſerved to have been branded with perpetual infamy, for I never knew any man in this Kingdome that did keep correſpondency with them: neither had I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Majeſty, or the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe</hi> to treat with any, I did indeed ſpeak with ſome Noblemen and Gentlemen, becauſe I was formerly obliged unto them for their love to me, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them ſome ſmall aſſiſtance to furniſh, me in my journey; but I never ſpake with them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the publike Affairs, no further than the weekly <hi>Gazets</hi> made known to all the world; if theſe great Fiſh could have been taken in our Stateſmens Nets, it might have been that ſuch a Minim as I, ſhould have eſcaped the Bayliff of the Fiſh-markets hand this day.</p>
            <p>I have been from my youth a Souldier; and though that Calling in it ſelf be honourable, yet men in that Calling have greater occaſions and provocations to ſin than in any private Calling. Beſides naturally my youth led me to ſome abominable ſins, and cuſtom in them did for many years detain me captive unto them; ſo that I cannot but confeſſe, that to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth ſhame and confuſion in this life, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſoul and body eternally in Hell fire, if God ſhould deal with me according to my deſert; my comfort is, that the blood of my Saviour cries lowder in his ears for mercy, than my ſins doe for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and that he who hath promiſed a free pardon and remiſſion unto all penitent ſinners through faith
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:116038:120"/>
in Jeſus Chriſt, will purge and cleanſe my Soul from all uncleaneſſe, and deliver me from all blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the blood of his Son our Saviour. The true ſorrow that I find in my Soul for my former ſins, and that godly reſolution and ſtedfaſt purpoſe I have to lead a new life if it pleaſe God to continue it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the joy, the patience, and the courage I have to ſuffer, gives me ſome aſſurance of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope, that through faith in Chriſt Jeſus my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, my penitent Soul though ſinful ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And as for my Religion, I die, as I lived, a true Proteſtant; this Religion, I thank God, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me from Popiſh Superſtition, ſo it kept me from being ſeduced by the Novelties of the times, and from being deluded with the wicked Doctrine which is now taught by the Reformers of the Kirk. It was this Religion which did keep my hand from your Covenant: of which in the ſpace of ſome five years you gave two interpretations, quite contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; for in the year 1639. the Aſſembly did affirm (as appears by our Acts of Parliament and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) that in all cauſes whatſoever you were to defend and maintain the perſon and dignity of your King; but in the year 1644. you limit your obedience to your King, to your Religion, Laws, and Liberty; and make your ſelves in all differences between the King and you, both Judge and Party. The Religion in which I was bred, taught me to give both to God, and my King their due; it taught me to honour and worſhip God, and to expect Salvation through Chriſt; and to live ſoberly, and to deal juſtly with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:116038:121"/>
all men. I ever hated that Religion which made Saints or Angels ſharers with God in his worſhip; or men partakers with my Redeemer in the work of my Redemption, or that made our Chriſtian liberty a cloak of maliciouſneſſe; and though naturally I incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to evill, and wicked company drew me to moſt hainous and filthy ſins; yet I thank God I hated that Religion that taught impiety and wickedneſſe, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Murther and Injuſtice, or that approved the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Kings and their loyal Subjects for their loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as having its original rather from the Devill, who was a murtherer from the beginning, than from God; and I did ever eſteem it more aggreable to mans ſinfull and corrupted nature, than to Gods holy Word. I have heard a learned man ſay, that it were better to deny God to be, than to believe him to be ſuch an one who delights in the bloody ſacrifices of men and women, or to think that he is ſuch an one who delights in cruelty and murther; the God whom we ſerve and worſhip, is the Savior of the world, the peſerver of man, the Redeemer of Man-kind, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of his blood. I have been taught from Gods word, that he hath no pleaſure in wickedneſſe, neither ſhall any evil dwell with him; undoubtedly ſuch bloody Sacrifices cannot be pleaſing or acceptable to him, for they are repugnant to his nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Juſtice and equity of his holy Law.</p>
            <p>It is my greateſt grief at this time, I did not walk according to the purity of my Religion, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of God, who hath called us to the knowledge of his truth. Therefore let me entreat you to pray
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:116038:121"/>
unto God with me, and for me, that he would be pleaſed to pardon my many and great ſins; that he would purge my ſoul with the blood of his Son, from the guilt and pollution of all my ſins; that I may be preſented unto my heavenly Father without ſpot or wrinkle, holy, without blemiſh; that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me through the merits of my Saviour into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting peace, and into the glorious eſtate of his choſen Saints in heaven. O Lord into thy hands I commend my ſoul; Lord Jeſu receive my ſpirit; O merciful Father forgive my Enemies, and lay not this ſin to their charge, <hi>Amen.</hi>
